Metro Police spokesman Don Aaron says in a <a href=#>statement</a> that Capps forced his 60-year-old wife and 23-year-old stepdaughter into their family room at gunpoint at around 3AM and “told them if they called someone, he would kill them," adding that they were "extremely frightened."</p><p>Capps reportedly fell asleep near dawn, and his wife and daughter fled the home and went to a nearby police precinct to file a report. A SWAT team was dispatched after warrants were issued at 1:55PM, and shortly after, they arrived at Capps' home, where he confronted officers by brandishing a gun in the doorway. A SWAT team member opened fire and killed him at the scene after determining that his actions constituted an immediate threat, according to Aaron.</p><p>Aaron's YouTube statement, which is age-restricted because it shows potentially disturbing footage of the confrontation and its aftermath, goes on to say that Capps' wife and daughter had told police that he had threatened to shoot not only them, but any police officers who might show up.</p><p>Authorities subsequently found that Capps had cameras monitoring the outside of his home, Aaron told reporters according to Nashville's <a href=#>News Channel 5</a>. Aaron states that the approaching officers were clearly marked and identified as members of law enforcement in SWAT gear.</p><p>Capps' <a href=#>website</a> lists a long and impressive roster of all-star clients, including <a href=#>Alabama</a>, the <a href=#>Chicks</a>, <a href=#>Amy Grant</a>, <a href=#>Brooks & Dunn</a>, <a href=#>Chris Young</a>, <a href=#>Aaron Tippin</a>, Conway Twitty, <a href=#>Joe Diffie</a>, the <a href=#>Oak Ridge Boys</a>, <a href=#>Big & Rich</a>, <a href=#>John Michael Montgomery</a>, <a href=#>Kenny Rogers</a>, the <a href=#>Mavericks</a>, <a href=#>Anita Cochran</a>, <a href=#>Olivia Newton-John</a> and more country acts, as well as a string of artists from other genres outside of country. He won Grammy Awards for Best Polka Album for his work with Jimmy Sturr & His Orchestra in four successive years, from 2005-2008.</p><p>Capps came from a prominent Music City family; his father was Jimmy Capps, the longtime <a href=#>Grand Ole Opry</a> guitarist, famed session player and Musicians Hall of Fame member who <a href=#>died in 2020</a>. According to Capps' <a href=#>final post on Facebook</a>, dated Jan. 3, his brother had also died just prior to his fatal shooting.</p><p>An investigation into the shooting will determine if responding officers acted appropriately.</p><p>A number of Capps' musical friends and collaborators were among those who turned to social media to express sadness and disbelief at the circumstances of his death, with some openly questioning why the situation wasn't treated more delicately as a mental health crisis:</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>In Memoriam: Country Stars Who Have Died in 2022</h2><p>May they rest in peace ...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmp5mjncOquMueZJ6ml567prHRZqerp5SqsKa%2BjKaYq6NdmK6xvNJmm56ZlGKxqrHSZqqwmaRiwaatzGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnashville-engineer-producer-mark-capps-dead-dies-swat-team.html&text=Grammy-Winning%20Nashville%20Hitmaker%20Mark%20Capps%20Killed%20by%20SWAT%20Team&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnashville-engineer-producer-mark-capps-dead-dies-swat-team.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnashville-engineer-producer-mark-capps-dead-dies-swat-team.html&title=Grammy-Winning%20Nashville%20Hitmaker%20Mark%20Capps%20Killed%20by%20SWAT%20Team" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnashville-engineer-producer-mark-capps-dead-dies-swat-team.html&title=Grammy-Winning%20Nashville%20Hitmaker%20Mark%20Capps%20Killed%20by%20SWAT%20Team" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnashville-engineer-producer-mark-capps-dead-dies-swat-team.html&title=Grammy-Winning%20Nashville%20Hitmaker%20Mark%20Capps%20Killed%20by%20SWAT%20Team" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnashville-engineer-producer-mark-capps-dead-dies-swat-team.html&description=Grammy-Winning%20Nashville%20Hitmaker%20Mark%20Capps%20Killed%20by%20SWAT%20Team" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-wash-good-quality-wigs-6829600.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's How to Wash Good Quality Wigs the Right Way">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./535942-angel-fangs-angel-bites-differences-similarities.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angel fangs vs angel bites: The differences and similarities">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
