What are you doing?' I went to take the blindfold off and he shouted, in a panic, 'Don't take it off, don't take it off.' He was obviously adjusting himself. I did take it off, and I just knew something had happened. I remember feeling very uncomfortable.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'It was always at the back of my mind what he had done. You know when you have that feeling something was not right.

'It was only when I was told that he had done it to someone else that it confirmed it for me.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She was one of the women who made child abuse allegations against Weller in 2002.

'He got me to sit on a toilet seat,' she said. 'He was standing in front of me, and I remember feeling very uncomfortable about his presence.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Like the first accuser the woman, now in her 40s and a mother, cannot be named for legal reasons and her family also trusted Weller. She said of her experience: 'As an adult you can put it into context, but as a young child, you can't. Over the years you put it away in the back of your mind, 'Oh that didn't happen,' and then when I heard of other abuse it confirmed to me what had happened.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'If going public means someone else will ring the NSPCC or go to the police and are offered counselling, then it is worth me going through this again.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She blasted police and the CPS for dropping the case against Weller in 2003.
