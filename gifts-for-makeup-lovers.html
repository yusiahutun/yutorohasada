However, others reciprocate our feelings tenfold, and whether it was a slow burn or love at first sight, we feel confident our most cherished picks will make an outstanding gift for the makeup lover in your life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We wouldn’t recommend any shadow we hadn’t swatched ourselves or send you home with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>long-lasting lipstick</a> that couldn't make it through the third course intact. Many of these products we tested ourselves, and others come highly recommended by experts, but all of them are gifts we’re sure someone you love would squeal over.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kindred-black-hypokrites-finishing-powder></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kindred Black Hypokrites Finishing Powder</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kindred Black Hypokrites Finishing Powder" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2RDz6JCSXZS_1vcEe8b-Sw1cTFs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kindred-Black-Hypokrites-Finishing-Powder-87bc4233e261426792f8c9d5f732c31a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kindred Black</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We have been patiently waiting for this gorgeous highlighting powder that feels softer than silk and looks whiter and finer than freshly fallen, glistening snow. But that’s definitely not to say only the fairest among us can dust our temples and cheeks with this delicate powder — far from it! We’ve never felt a finishing powder lighter than this, tamping down our excess shine with a soft-focus matte finish that still leaves our skin with just the right amount of glowing radiance. If you think that giving someone a finishing powder for a gift is too ordinary, just one look at the milky-hued hand-blown bottle swirled with an iridescent luster, as if it was sculpted straight from a mother-of-pearl, topped with an apothecary-style cork and wax sealing. "If heaven was a beauty vessel, this would be it," says InStyle's Senior Beauty Commerce Editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kaitlin Clark</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wthn-rose-quartz-eye-mask></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>WTHN Rose Quartz Eye Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="WTHN Rose Quartz Eye Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lcSrEHNO-IENi3D6OeYUddULAXQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wthn-rose-quartz-eye-mask-11d60c212d994591a55f46682ead476f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>WTHN</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Consider this luxuriously soothing eye mask a gift from the self-care gods. According to ancient Greek lore, rose quartz formed when the tears of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, fell onto her wounded lover, Adonis, and the flow of his blood mixed with her tears stained the Greek white quartz pink. Even today it’s known as the “Love Stone,” and although we can’t attest to that, we do love a romantic myth, but even more, we love an ice-cold (as long as you keep it in the freezer), intricately woven gemstone eye mask that feels like a cool weighted blanket for your face. “It feels delicious every day, but especially after too many hours spent staring at a screen. At the end of the day, I take it out of the icebox, lay down, cover my eyes, and I can genuinely feel my jaw unclench," says Clark, "which is probably just Aphrodite unblocking my heart chakra herself so I radiate waves of loving energy.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tom-ford-hearts-eyeshadow-palette></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tom Ford Hearts Eyeshadow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Tom Ford Hearts Eyeshadow Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6TRu_EXW9s7aM_Bu1O7Ro-CC7mk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Tom-Ford-Hearts-Eyeshadow-Palette-b171f2f9b8db41c4a7792eda1189db71.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When Tom Ford offers a gift to the world in the form of four heart-shaped, romantic eyeshadows that sparkle like little firecrackers of shimmer, all encased in a glossy, classic red apple quad, you just say yes. "These hues aren’t just regular shimmers," says Clark. "I think of them as intellectually sparkly eyeshadows," she adds, meaning that they're fit for even the most mature personalities among us. "Because for the record," says Clark, "No one ages out of glitter."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vyrao-witchy-incense></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vyrao Witchy Incense</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bluemercury Vyrao Witchy Incense" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2Mh_GG_btKlXq_bQLdV9vOoFmpU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Vyrao-Witchy-Incense-e6950bf6e3ae45fa85d3c584d75e1abe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bluemercury</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">February is the perfect time of year to tap into the power of supernatural scents — and a mysteriously magnetic fragrance, with an aromatic waft that is subtle, invisible, and hopelessly captivating, is bewitching indeed. Designed to intensify one’s courage and creativity, Witchy Woo gets straight to the point, as a bold, earthy blend of orris intertwines with musky patchouli, sharp thorny rose, cinnamon, honey-like opoponax, and swirled with spicy nutmeg. "I love a complex, layered fragrance that hits you in waves, and every time I light one of these slender sticks, I find another note I didn't smell before," says Clark. "It's warm, sensual, spicy, kind of smoky and sweet, and firmly in the amber fragrance family. I also love that the brand blends luxury perfumery with mood-boosting, energizing notes; it's a whole new world of wellness and self-care."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-prada-dimensions-multi-effect-refillable-eyeshadow-palette></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Prada Dimensions Multi-Effect Refillable Eyeshadow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Prada Dimensions Multi-Effect Refillable Eyeshadow Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8YxqFf7ksduhoYQ27HT2jqC3UB4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Prada-Dimensions-Multi-Effect-Refillable-Eyeshadow-Palette-14aa1595781e40e0951f970417d02b4e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to really impress your love, splurge for one of the art-forward eyeshadow palettes from the very first launch of Prada Colour, the cosmetics arm of the storied Italian fashion house. Equal parts luxury, art, and supreme wearability, these hotly sought-after palettes feature three neutral shades and one flashy accent. "At first, you may not think these shades, all with a different finish, are all that complementary," says Clark. "But just trust me, and layer with abandon. You'll love the surprise, and it looks different every time you wear it." Wear them together, or choose your favorite finish, from satin to matte to metal foil, and wear it as it's own colorstory. Each palette is inspired by one of the brand’s vast library of more than 27,000 textiles and patterns.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gucci-gloss--lvres-hydrating-plumping-lip-gloss></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gucci Gloss à Lèvres</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gucci Gloss a Levres in Teresina Red" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gWCSesCmIbZmAtyLIX_hp9x6EGE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Gucci-Gloss-a-Levres-in-Teresina-Red-68e329b8d6fa438fafd11f792113a8d2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gucci</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Gucci Gloss à Lèvres is a true testament that some love languages require no words at all. One swipe of it and just our icy glazed smirks and fuller lips could fill an entire conversation. “Since the applicator is bent at about a 45-degree angle, it’s easy to maneuver the smooth gloss around my lip line and cover every inch with the fiery, semi-sheer red tint which looks daring on its own, but even more enticing when I overlay it on top of a coordinating <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>classic red lipstick</a>,” says InStyle Commerce Writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Irene Richardson</a>. Beyond its kissable qualities, the gloss ditches a sticky, goopy finish in favor of a hydrating feel, courtesy of hyaluronic acid and naturally plumping plant-based extracts, such as ginger root and capsicum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Plus, between the tube’s smattering of little stars and luxe gold accents, this gloss is simply a fun accessory to cart around and pull out whenever I’m not getting enough attention and could do with a compliment or two,” adds Richardson.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jay-strongwater-wow-compact></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jay Strongwater Wow Compact</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bergdorf Goodman Jay Strongwater Wow Compact" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/L4XHtSRpsHOUiRIbBq5uf7n2RUk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jay-Strongwater-Wow-Compact-d881e35fe2bf4ba19589222eef6905b8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bergdorf Goodman</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This funky compact is complete with Swarovski crystals (ooh la la) and an impressionable pop art design that stuffs personality into its three-inch circumference.

Our trick to keeping our vanity orderly? Chic trays, boxes, and jars galore! Pay no mind to the label on this spiky, spunky case — after all, one person’s towel holder is another’s flashy spectacle.

This material also holds onto coolness longer, leaving you with a few extra minutes in the morning to treat extra inflamed skin with some TLC. Equally notable is how its adorable pink hue doubles as a decorative nightstand accessory fit for any beauty guru’s boudoir. Additionally, their slim silhouettes are easy to throw in any tote and travel with, and ensure we always have the secret weapon right by our side if we need to calm down angry, red skin or keep up with our face-shaping treatments.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-charlotte-tilbury-hollywood-beauty-icon-lip-kit></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Beauty Icon Lip Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Beauty Icon Lip Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lZH1pzpNa0l63HfjZNT7j1m6pRo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Charlotte-Tilbury-Hollywood-Beauty-Icon-Lip-Kit-8746aa25ff9541a2bcbf9e1d8a2d4101.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Charlotte Tilbury</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Icons only, please (yes, that’s you). Charlotte Tilbury expanded the Hollywood Beauty Icon line to five new matte and satin shades and lip liners in the sweetest pinky hues, which you can easily coordinate with this Lip Kit. We got our mitts on the entire collection and adored how each one of the shades felt versatile to wear anywhere, even the brighter bubblegum pink, which isn’t a shade we’d normally go for during the week.&nbsp; “Lip liners and red lipsticks are my makeup white whales if you will, but I thought there was no better time to try the bold, scarlet Hollywood Vixen shade and liner before a swanky late-night event downtown, and it did not disappoint,” says Richardson who adds that she was impressed by how the matte shade didn’t dry out her lips or smudge outside her lip line, instead it stayed in place all evening.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dior-forever-cushion-powder></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dior Forever Cushion Powder</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Dior Forever Cushion Powder" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5S3fCrFie_mLS7jk4BHKuCjRioU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dior-Forever-Cushion-Powder-668cb74da0c940b4ace75fec0e037294.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We may be all grown up now, but really, who doesn’t still dream of spending their days in a fairy garden? Between the blooming scene stitched on the outside of the compact and lavender-hued powder inside, the Dior Forever Cushion Powder is completely ethereal. An impressive feat, given that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>setting powder</a>, isn’t typically the sexiest purchase, but we’d be thrilled if our honey gifted us this practical item encased in a vintage-style makeup accessory. Aesthetics aside, the mattifying translucent powder relies on water and wild pansy extract to provide a soft, cushiony feel you can sweep all over and never worry about a cakey, patchy finish.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-typology-tinted-lip-oil></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Typology Tinted Lip Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Typology Tinted Lip Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AUsLcjAiT4jfuHe0APXmTfeSXK4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Typology-Tinted-Lip-Oil-465db918eaf547f69fc95ce1bd66cd5f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Typology</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Formulated in France, Typology lives up to its Parisian standards and formulates a lip oil that's equal parts simple, elegant, and sexy. “The lip oil tastes delicious (Is that weird to say?), and despite having the urge to lick my lips every five seconds the Ruby Red shade slightly stained my lips for long-lasting color, similar to after eating a cherry popsicle but without the sugary red ring and with far more chic-looking results,” says Richardson. She adds that the vegan formula, which is brimming with hydrating plant-based oils, “melted into my skin and made my lips appear fuller, healthier, and dare I admit, super, super kissable.” Say coucou.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lunya-sleep-the-details-3-piece-kit></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lunya Sleep the Details 3 Piece Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shopbop Lunya Sleep the Details 3 Piece Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8u_oIFcEY1xHLAsnSFw94PUMKYA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lunya-Sleep-the-Details-3-Piece-Kit-4c6e5e09f2ba4fc3a8531b3944ada329.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Any makeup lover will tell you beauty rest is essential, and wax poetic about the way a bad night’s sleep can wreak such havoc on your look the following day even a really good concealer couldn’t fix. This three-piece set from the same eco-conscious brand that makes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>our favorite silk pajamas</a> is ideal for falling asleep feeling like a princess and waking up looking like one too. The 100 percent silk fabric helps prevent breakouts and keep blowouts smooth and frizz at bay no matter how much you toss and turn.

Not only does it come with step-by-step instructions for where to place each of the four shades, which includes a contour, bronzer, highlighter, and blush, but the velvety soft powders apply like a dream and are mistake-proof. “I’ll admit my contouring skills are quite lacking but when I do pick up the practice I usually opt for creams because I find them easier to manipulate and less drying, however after using this palette I’m a total powder convert,” says Richardson. She adds that the shades feel just as hydrating as liquid products, probably because the formula contains skin-nourishing ingredients, like passionfruit oil and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vitamin E</a>, and the subtle, but buildable, color payoff makes them much less daunting to use.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tower-28-lipsoftie-lip-treatment></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tower 28 LipSoftie Lip Treatment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tube of Tower28 LipSoftie Treatment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ENSt_LFh4mkmPVKsbaArhx4Poq8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Tower28LipSoftieTreatment-172d1f449a254613ac6e925bf6cb254b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tower 28</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sunny Days Tinted Sunscreen</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>cream blushes</a>, the sensitive-skin friendly and Gen-Z-adored brand created a lip treatment that's part skincare, part makeup, and fully fun. “The gloss has a deliciously thick, jelly-like consistency that’s pleasantly un-sticky and affords me the pleasure of squeezing it out of its squishy tube all day long,” says Richardson. “The light aromatic vanilla fragrance accompanying the glosses smells similar to a fancy piece of candy–not too sweet, not too strong, but an addicting aroma any sugar addict will love all the same.” Shea butter, jojoba seed oil, and olive oil extracts drench skin with hydration, giving your smackers a plush look and pillowy feel, as the moisture naturally inflates lips. And, if super high-shine finishes aren’t your thing, you’ll appreciate the subtle, sheer wash of color from each of the five shades. &nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kristin-ess-the-vegan-leather-bows-hair-elastic></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kristin Ess The Vegan Leather Bows Hair Elastic</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Target Kristin Ess The Vegan Leather Bows Hair Elastic" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Jnf0YNocR9mR2nibLzt8e7271k8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kristin-Ess-The-Vegan-Leather-Bows-Hair-Elastic-c640cf41e98a41e2b6f19055d20a81ed.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we don’t have a headband nearby to keep wispies out of our eyeline– i.e. we’re hazardously doing our makeup in the backseat of an Uber — the proverbial hair band is our next best option.

Still, we think even if Geske Facial Cleansing Brush didn’t have a gorgeous tear-drop silhouette and beautiful gold and pink accented outfit, it would be a glamorous gift. “You’re essentially saying to your friend ‘Hey, here’s a little facial on me every single day' —seriously, between the tiny vibrations, warming sensation from the metal micro pearls, and flexible soft bristles the pocket-sized tool the whole enchilada," says Richardson. Plus, if your giftee is new to skincare or doesn’t have a ton of time to set up and use a complicated device on the daily, the brush is beginner-friendly and even coordinates with an app with pre-set treatments to make the entire process that much easier.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-balmain-paris-hair-perfume></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Balmain Paris Hair Perfume</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Balmain Paris Hair Perfume" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WX4aJv0AYShKF5NN_RtRUgIO2jo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Balmain-Paris-Hair-Perfume-f3eaff3c4bd049ea87fa103c8f686b56.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Stunningly understated, every single thing about the signature hair perfume from Balmain, from the chic black and white glass bottle to the aromatic cocktail of sweet raspberry and tangy orange blossom, grounded in earthy cedar and pine, evokes a classic Parisian style.

The exfoliator works by gently buffing off dry skin with sugar crystals and a patented formula with nourishing ingredients like sea kelp and eucalyptus, leaving them feeling slightly sweetened by the mint, plumper, and pillow soft.

Sure, that’s nice, but it’s kind of a big yawn compared to the powerful impact the Diptyque Eau Rose will leave on the wearer and everyone around them. Its scent is a fresh take on the classic flower and relies on intriguing notes of lychee, camomile, and artichoke for an energizing, greener fragrance you’re likely to wear every day. The mature fragrance is a welcome deviation from the traditionally sweet scent that still holds all the excitement of seeing a floral bouquet by your nightstand. Not to mention, the delicately etched roses on the bottle never lose their petals and serve as a classic piece of decor that will (hopefully) remain as eternal as your love.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-saie-dew-blush></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Saie Dew Blush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Saie Dew Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QV1GiSK79wSdqbLMvmSSLlJlgAs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Saie-Dew-Blush-3150e786ce86468cac9cc4149ff16afb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Maybe you have someone who brings about your flush au natural (don’t brag), but for those of us who want to turn on the coquettish charm, the Saie Dew Blush is our flirty little helper. “I tried all three shades but continuously came back to Sweetie — it’s just pink enough to subtly warm up the apples of my cheeks, and I’m obsessed with the slightly dewy finish on all the shades that allows me to skip the highlighter.” The pigment is everything promised too, we barely had to dot it on with the wide, ultra cushiony doe foot applicator and blend out with our fingers to see it take to our complexion with a skin-like finish.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-caudalie-premier-cru-anti-aging-serum-with-niacinamide-and-hyaluronic-acid></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Caudalie Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Caudalie Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum with Niacinamide and Hyaluronic Acid" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Z4ctM6TVaEWOBK_MvfheViZw0M8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Caudalie-Premier-Cru-Anti-Aging-Serum-with-Niacinamide-and-Hyaluronic-Acid-e626d8c4ae484e38834aea558f4508fd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Caudalie</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, skincare has a romantic edge. What says “I love you” more than the fact that we’re willing to spill our magical anti-aging skincare secrets? “As I’m inching closer to thirty, I’ve started to notice fine lines around my forehead and smile lines, and I’ve tried a bunch of more affordable serums, upped my retinol, and did all that forums recommend to no avail,” says Kratky, who adds she finally decided to splurge on the Caudalie Premier Cru serum.&nbsp; “This serum is truly magical, it whipped my face into shape and took three years off my skin,” she says. The serum touts a powerhouse formula with highly concentrated hyaluronic acid, a naturally derived, more effective version of vitamin C, and patented technology proven to help tighten skin.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gucci-the-alchemists-garden-a-chant-for-the-nymph-eau-de-parfum></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gucci The Alchemist's Garden A Chant for the Nymph Eau de Parfum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bloomingdale's Gucci The Alchemist's Garden A Chant for the Nymph Eau de Parfum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CtBp09RDj7933wjz9pIocyiHqPA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Gucci-The-Alchemists-Garden-A-Chant-for-the-Nymph-Eau-de-Parfum-60ee7d8fc279425298ec601bbd012376.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bloomingdale's</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Etched with a lithe cursive gold lettering and a sage green bow right below the designer label, the romantic ballet slipper pink bottle looks like we swiped it directly from a Parisian socialite’s nightstand. Only a hint of citrusy sharpness cuts through the otherwise fruity-floral perfume oil, which makes us feel flirty, sophisticated, and intriguing at the same time–like something our fictional French friend would wear before securing a silk scarf around her neck and heading out for a late afternoon stroll with a promising date. “The fragrance dries down to a creamy, soft vanilla scent, but it still retains its bright profile, making me want to wear it squeezed in tight next to Mon Cheri, perhaps sitting together on a terrace bench bordered by flowers, drinking rose tea,” says Richardson.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-alexandre-de-paris-swarovski-crystal-studded-jaw-hair-clip></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Alexandre De Paris Swarovski Crystal Studded Jaw Hair Clip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bergdorf Goodman Alexandre De Paris Swarovski Crystal Studded Jaw Hair Clip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yAzTbO8AeIJatoTletTX4mAAaoU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Alexandre-De-Paris-Swarovski-Crystal-Studded-Jaw-Hair-Clip-910d657918b84275b1ea533590e5d507.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bergdorf Goodman</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Look, we’d love to drip out our significant others in head-to-toe diamonds. However, if a stadium-sized jewel isn’t in the budget this year, at least start with the hair, and give your honey a fancy way to sweep away strands while they buff on skincare and makeup. Consider the stunning cream-colored or glossy black Swarovski crystal claw clip as not only a useful trick for making third-day hair look chic, but the hair accessory is a more contemporary, and accessible, version of a tiara they can wear every day.

(The gold heart-shaped zipper is the cherry on top of an already adorable design.) Naturally, Stoney Clover is the ultimate girl’s girl and the designer knows every makeup lover needs oodles of space to store their collected treasures of bits, baubles, and blushes. We could easily pack the large case full of brushes and full-sized palettes galore and keep it all organized with the option to purchase smaller, variously shaped pouches that will corral more miscellaneous items together.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-geurlain-cherry-blossom></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Geurlain Cherry Blossom</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Geurlain Cherry Blossom" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DWVNL4VB3I_PPIOqUqQWpdicgWw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Geurlain-Cherry-Blossom-10f93e5492054e53914fac1fbdceacc4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Geurlain</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps you’re celebrating a milestone anniversary or maybe you just really like the new person you’re seeing (lucky them). Either way, the Guerlain Cherry Blossom perfume is a very worthy alternative to a fine piece of jewelry. This stunning masterpiece not only features a versatile and light clean fragrance practically anyone would find delectable but it’s housed in a true work of art, and this labor of love translates tenfold when gifted. Guerlain worked with a French jeweler to design a truly spectacular crystal bottle featuring gleaming, semi-precious stones, artfully designed mother-of-pearl sakura cherry blossoms, and the brand’s signature bee emblems. It's unique, it’s everlasting, and most importantly it’ll earn you major brownie points.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-byredo-eyeshadow-5-colours></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Byredo Eyeshadow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Byredo Eyeshadow 5 Colours in Dysco" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Yukx1nVez2TJ_950EkzzrzkBPpQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Byredo-Eyeshadow-5-Colours-f5a07536bb5242cea49e9cd2d3d47073.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Byredo</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We can hardly believe it’s been nearly four years since one of our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tried and true fragrance brands</a> delved into the world of makeup and released enchanting eye palettes equally as enticing as its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>undeniably sexy hair perfume</a>. Notably, the quintet of striking metallic hues featured in the new State of Emotion set sends us straight into a dreamy romantic haze colored by burnished bronzes, royal roses, and an all-too-alluring deep shimmery burgundy. However, unlocking any of the oyster-shell-shaped palettes promises a treat to the user because the formulas are long-wearing, and offer high-impact color that sweeps across eyelids with high impact.

It's easy to manipulate the blendable formula to enhance your natural eye shape so that you can create whatever look your heart desires, though we’re tempted to go full glam by way of the indulgent warm hazel hues and sparkly deep berry-colored shadows.

The ultra-hydrating Joanna Czech sheet mask forbids dehydration by replenishing our skin with a cocktail of hyaluronic acid, coconut oil, and sunflower seed oil to soothe away redness and create a smooth even base ahead of the most daring looks.

Leave it to the designer brand to take what would be an afterthought product and transform it into a luxurious pillowy treat for our visage. The soft tri-layer cotton material treats especially sensitive skin with care and removes makeup seamlessly without leaving a trail of pilling fabric. Not to mention, the interlocking C’s and stunning packaging each set comes in, dress-up bathroom vanities with an air of elegance any house guest can appreciate.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-riki-loves-riki-riki-skinny-mirror></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Riki Loves Riki Riki Skinny Mirror</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Riki Loves Riki Riki Skinny Mirror" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3bW_8jB2XAFLSsSATCMHwYmbHEw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Riki-Loves-Riki-Riki-Skinny-Mirror-e94f605d1afe4f0693ba01d8b3574ea8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Riki Loves Riki</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s a must-have for snatched makeup looks, whether you want a minimalist no-makeup makeup look or a full beat.

Even if the British makeup brand wasn’t the one often behind celebrity and runway looks, we’d feel like a true A-lister layering our lashes with the luxurious mascara.

Additionally, she says “Though small in stature, these multi-use pencils are quite overachievers — the slim sparkling eyeshadow stick doubles as a subtle highlighter, whereas the chubbier contour stick is easy to hold and its width allows me to quickly blend from my forehead to my cheekbones and down the jawline.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tom-ford-soleil-blanc-shimmering-body-oil></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tom Ford Soleil Blanc Shimmering Body Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Tom Ford Soleil Blanc Shimmering Body Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/75uamUXgiwmbuW7hL5DEAk9AhxM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Tom-Ford-Soleil-Blanc-Shimmering-Body-Oil-3efc03ef319d45fcb454954763ad2f9e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s pretty hard to top the gift of glow. Walking among the sunny orchards of Grecian olive trees seems well within reach when our arms and legs are oiled up in the sumptuous, silky Tom Ford Body Oil. Plant-based ingredients such as jojoba, safflower, and olive drench skin and leave it with heaven-sent softness, while flecks of glitter make limbs look longer and irresistible to the touch. What makes the body oil even harder to ignore is the fresh fragrances trailing in its application, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>we previously described</a> as a little floral with a bit of kick from spicy notes of amber accords and sandalwood.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hermes-plein-air-blotting-papers></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hermes Plein Air Blotting Papers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Hermes Plein Air Blotting Papers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0jeAvqUNsAsVXS9UCHNc2w5ckw0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hermes-Plein-Air-Blotting-Papers-66fce6b98bc24de5a913fd420bef3ed9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sweating? In designer? We’d only allow it if we could blot away the extra oil with the fibers of Japanese mulberry tree found in the Hermes Plein Air Blotting Papers. Is it a little silly to splurge on? That’s up to you, but if you ask us, life is all about the little things, and pulling out these pocket-sized sheets of joy from the signature Hermes orange packaging makes our daily lives that much better. Even the papers themselves carry the ghost of the designer logo with a faint watermark. Trust us, no one will mistake these for run-of-the-mill blotting sheets.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drunk-elephant-b-goldi-bright-drops-with-5-niacinamide></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant B-Goldi Bright Drops</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Drunk Elephant B-Goldi Bright Drops" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RMxXrTyoo5WTHK7j0I2WgXp7HbI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/drunk-elephant-b-goldi-bright-drops-c4a28de0aca643c1bd94b2d10d0d9803.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Drunk Elephant</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Why would we ever want to escape the brilliant, gleaming world Drunk Elephant drenches our skin in every time we slather one of its illuminating drops onto our skin? Whether we’re using the versatile, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>TikTok-lauded bronzing drops</a> to beam sunlight back onto our facades or adding color to cheekbones by patting on the blush equivalent, we’re obsessed with the lightweight makeup, skincare hybrid products.

We’re recast as potion makers and magicians when we uncap the mystical hand-blown glass bottle and use the elegant dropper to layer on the treasure encased inside. The results are so exquisite, that it’s almost as though magic is one of the secret ingredients. In reality, Kindred relies on a medley of natural extracts, including blueberry and peppermint oils, to leave lips glazed, nourished, and enticing as ever.

The palette is brimming with gunmetal metallics and cosmic colorways fit for the solar system and made for you to smoke out a room with the sultriest looks. When you break them apart, however, the muted nudes and subtle shimmer shades offer plenty of versatility, if say, you want to create a more natural eye during the day and reserve your grunge era for nights out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Richardson, who doesn’t typically opt for heavier looks during the week, was thrilled to discover that she often picked up the palette when doing her makeup for work. As she explains, “I use LUV Anarchy, the quintessential light nude base, and Stand Up, an absolutely stunning sheer shimmery tan, and blend them out quickly and seamlessly into a gorgeous everyday look that’s complementary to all of my outfits.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-slip-the-glam-band-leopard-print-mulberry-silk-headband></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Slip Mulberry Silk Headband</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Slip The Glam Band Leopard-Print Mulberry Silk Headband" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3Og5dzsBdw1SmwUrvGYoIYHiDCI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Slip-The-Glam-Band-Leopard-Print-Mulberry-Silk-Headband-6c6b5fb6d94f49adbd71bc273566e03e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We sleep soundly every night on our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Slip silk pillowcases</a>, but when beauty rest just doesn’t cut it, we use Slip’s adorable silky, soft fabric headband to keep stubborn strands out of our way and flyaway infringements at bay when we need to zhuzh our makeup. The thick headband is wide enough to hold back our precious blowouts keeping them safe from splashback and product residue. And, no matter how long it takes to blend out our smoky eyes, we won’t remove the headband to find frizz or a headache thanks to the brand’s propriety silk fabric that smooths down hair instead of creating more frizz and adjustable loop fastener versus a velcro one, which ensures we aren’t snagging strands when we pull the headband off.&nbsp; To be honest,&nbsp; the cheetah-print design simply adds a cheer to our groggy mornings and glitz to our getting-ready routine.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dibs-beauty-glowtour-duo></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>DIBS Beauty GlowTour Duo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="DIBS Beauty GlowTour Duo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DjIh2kCaG1Y4xWw4b6N_CZjSLps=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/DIBS-Beauty-GlowTour-Duo-2c8b3b8c0107455baf6453ed0511027c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>DIBS Beauty</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Between its glowy finish and flecks of sparkle, our cheekbones seem to scintillate even in dimly lit rooms when we’re sporting this highlighter and blush super duo. In the best way, its packaging feels similar to using a glue stick because the chubby dual-ended tool is easy to hold, and its wide surface makes the application of the cream blush or shimmering highlighter even more seamless. As Richardson explains, “I have zero patience for blending out my product and even less so when it comes to searching for the right brush, so I loved that all I need to do when I wear this is rub it across the high points of my face and pat it in with my fingers. Voila, the silky formula melts right into my skin.” Ingenuity doesn’t stop at its design, however, as the innovative formula matches your skin’s natural pH to provide a made-for-you wash of color. Can you blame us for feeling special?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2ifmZvBtHnFqKlmpZGgsra8jKWmr52iqA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgifts-for-makeup-lovers.html&text=The%2051%20Best%20Gifts%20for%20Makeup%20Lovers%2c%20Tested%20by%20Us&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgifts-for-makeup-lovers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgifts-for-makeup-lovers.html&title=The%2051%20Best%20Gifts%20for%20Makeup%20Lovers%2c%20Tested%20by%20Us" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgifts-for-makeup-lovers.html&title=The%2051%20Best%20Gifts%20for%20Makeup%20Lovers%2c%20Tested%20by%20Us" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgifts-for-makeup-lovers.html&title=The%2051%20Best%20Gifts%20for%20Makeup%20Lovers%2c%20Tested%20by%20Us" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgifts-for-makeup-lovers.html&description=The%2051%20Best%20Gifts%20for%20Makeup%20Lovers%2c%20Tested%20by%20Us" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./toby-keith-dead-daughter-krystal-tribute.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Toby Keith's Daughter, Krystal, Shares Heart-Wrenching Tribute">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nelly-furtado-resurfaces-recent-health-diagnosis-comeback.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nelly Furtado resurfaces to reveal recent health diagnosis and comeback">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
