It’s a baby boy and they named him Leodis “Leo” Andrellton.</p><p>The Primetime Emmy Award-winning actress, singer, and television personality has happily taken her fans on the journey of her pregnancy on her Instagram <a href=#>@keke</a>. So, in these happy hours, it is natural that her fanatics are not only curious about her baby daddy, but also his parents.</p><p>In the rest of the writing, we shall therefore tell you all about Darius Jackson’s parents.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Darius Jackson’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Darius Jackson is the son of Romel Jackson and Yhinyer Hubbard. He was born to them in January 1994, making him 29 years old in 2023.</p><p>Now, let us tell you about each one of them, individually and together.</p><h3><strong>Meet Romel Jackson, Darius Jackson’s Father</strong></h3><p>Romel Jackson’s full name is Romel Paul Jackson. And Darius is clearly very fond of them. He often shows him off and writes sweet words bout him on social media.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Romel Jackson Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Romel Jackson was born in July 1958. So, he turned 64 years old in 2022.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Romel Jackson Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>On his Facebook, Romel Jackson mentioned currently working at Beach Cities Protection Services and formerly at the California Dept. of Corrections. He also briefly mentioned going to Rancocas Valley Regional High School.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Romel Jackson’s Ethnicity?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Romel Jackson is of mixed, i.e. African American descent.</p><p>He is originally from Philadelphia, and he and his wife gave birth to their son Darius in the Inland Empire metropolitan area that is centered around the cities of San Bernardino and Riverside and bordering Los Angeles County to the west.</p><h3><strong>Meet Yhinyer Hubbard, Darius Jackson’s Mother</strong></h3><p>Darius Jackson is also very much in love with his mother Yhinyer Hubbard. And more than once, she has also been seen on his social media looking as happy as she can be. For instance December 2022, Darius shared with his people how his mom was so happy that they visited Michael Jackson’s home in Gary, Indiana.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Yhinyer Hubbard Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yhinyer Hubbard was born in September 1960. So, she turned 62 years old in 2022.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Hubbard Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Since July 2003, Yhinyer Hubbard had been working as an HIM Director at Prime Healthcare Services in Corona, California, as of February 2023. On her LinkedIn profile, she also mentioned going to Instituto Fermin Naudeau<br>between 1974 and 1978.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Yhinyer Hubbard’s Ethnicity?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yhinyer Hubbard is a Panamanian-American of Hispanic descent. And she is proud of being one. She originally hails from Panama.</p><p>As a result, Darius is of Afro-Panamanian ancestry. On his social media, one can spot Darius talking about it. He says things like how he was accepted more in the African American community growing up, though he was half Panamanian.</p><p>While he fully adopts to his Afro-Panamanian roots, growing up with a mixed heritage was not always easy for him. Looking back, he bitterly recalls how the Mexican kids were not as accepting. Because they were not open to hanging outing with him, he also did not want to be in the Latinos circle. Instead, his Black friends were more welcoming. Afro-Latinidad, he says, is still a new concept to some.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Are Darius Jackson’s Parents Still Married?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>If the folks were still together and married until the time of this writing, was not known.
