On my last trip to <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Papua New Guinea</a> in 2022, I found a Louisiade pitta bird, which had been the focus of failed professional expeditions for years. It hadn’t been seen alive since 1898.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>We went around playing recordings of a related pitta, which sounds a bit like a <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">chicken being strangled</a>, until we received a reply. Imagine if you went around a haunted house rattling chains and then you heard a ghost rattling them back – that is what it was like.</p><figure id=315a2478-83fb-42aa-af6b-685d019347a1 data-spacefinder-role=showcase data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-5h0uf4><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>The Louisiade pitta bird, which was believed to be extinct before it was rediscovered by Michael Smith in 2022.</span> Photograph: Courtesy of Michael Smith</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>On another trip to Papua New Guinea, I went looking for a little possum called Telefomin cuscus, which was believed to have gone extinct after extensive forest fires in 1997.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>I found one, but unfortunately it was being barbecued by a local family. I really wished they had found another source of protein, but you can’t blame people for needing food.</p>I found one of the rare possums, but unfortunately it was being barbecued by a local family<p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In total, I have found a couple of dozen of these species, most of which are plants. My favourite discovery was the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo, which looks a bit like a cuddly toy, while looking for rhododendrons in West Papua four years ago. It had only been seen once – by the guy who shot it in 1928, and that specimen is now in the Natural History Museum in London.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>It took two expeditions to find it, and a lot of machete work through thorns and bamboo thickets that become overgrown almost as soon as you cut them. It was the last day and we saw the animal just before we needed to pack up. I was relieved – I would have had quite a lot of explaining to do to my wife if I came back empty-handed.</p><figure id=a9600416-f6cf-4d70-94e8-a130b60de610 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Telefomin Cuscus, a small possum, was believed to have gone extinct after forest fires in Papua New Guinea in 1997.</span> Photograph: Courtesy of Michael Smith</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>My wife is very patient and supportive, but she might think it’s a bit of crazy thing to do. She never comes with me on these trips – the furthest she’s ever gone with me is Devon, and that was a trip enough for her.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>I studied zoology at the University of Oxford, and ended up working in medical communications. I do a lot of computer modelling in my day job, and now I’m creating computer models of lost species, trying to work out the best place to look for them. You have to be fairly determined.</p><figure id=4ac06f43-e328-4b01-8c47-e4e29233dd7b data-spacefinder-role=showcase data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-5h0uf4><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Michael Smith in Frensham Ponds, Surrey. He spends his holidays searching for species that are believed to be extinct.</span> Photograph: Urszula Sołtys/The Guardian</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>I want these animals to be the poster children for seriously threatened and ancient habitats. I’m trying to get evidence of something interesting – and in terms of getting people involved and excited about conservation, it seems to be effective. I appreciate not everybody gets excited even about the most amazing plants, but they do like cuddly animals and beautiful exotic birds. If you are trying to find alternative jobs for hunters, you’ve got to think “what will tourists want to see?”, and that is what I set out to find.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>It’s a race against time to get people involved in conservation and ecotourism, as they don’t have many other options. I try to build connections between traditional landowners and organisations elsewhere to set up ecotourism facilities. That’s a way of putting food on people’s tables, and paying them to conserve their forests, which is what most people want to do.</p><figure id=b63aa5e9-976c-4a65-a80b-e73644f44159 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>The Wondiwoi tree kangaroo, rediscovered by Michael Smith in West Papua.</span> Photograph: Courtesy of Michael Smith</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>It’s hard to know if things will change fast enough for there to be anything left. In the 1990s, Papua New Guinea was just a big forest, with a few people. Now it’s still 80% or 90% forest, but there is huge pressure from people and investors who want to make palm oil. That’s a form of development which brings money to the region, but also builds major roads going up into the mountains.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>My tips for people who want to get into this are all very basic: keep fit, travel light, study the terrain and brush up your languages. Look after your porters and never try to rush discussions with local leaders.</p><figure id=3016e961-53dc-41f1-9d77-b05bd3f81ea3 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Papuan forest, where the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo was discovered.

I’ve had misadventures in the past with everyone from gorilla poachers in Cameroon to secret policemen in Burma, so I don’t want a “travelling circus”.</p><figure id=eb6bf053-abb3-4942-b883-399f67de4b7c data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>I discovered … a group of chimps that were using tools to crack open nutsRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>As for the future, I don’t know. I’m self-funded so I’m always short of cash. I’ve read old reports about a mythical beast in north-east India, which I suspect are based on some kind of giant salamander – the world’s largest amphibian.
