The 37-year-old has overcome numerous professional, personal, and physical struggles during this role to present a high-quality portrayal of vengeance.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>During an exclusive interview with us, the skilled star dished on her transformation into Kang Jiwon visually and mentally. She also spoke about her goals for this year as well as the kind of role she would like to go for next. Read the full interview below.</p><p><strong>There's a lot of talk about your journey to becoming Kang Jiwon visually. What was your favorite thing about becoming her and what was the toughest?</strong></p><p>It was eight months of more than what I thought was possible. Every moment was a challenge, a task, a mission. It was a battle with myself.</p><p><img alt="Park Min Young: courtesy of Studio Dragon" title="Park Min Young: courtesy of Studio Dragon" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-02/1707831273_park-min-young-3.jpg></p><p><strong>You’ve been the Queen of office romances, which co-star has been the best to work with, in these shows?</strong></p><p>Na In Woo is an actor who gives a lot with his eyes, so the chemistry with me was fine from the beginning and we became really good partners later on. We both delicately set the emotional lines, and I think the chemistry between the characters gradually improved as we had a lot of meetings and conversations. My first impression of him was that he was rough because of the previous film, but later on, he was like a cute puppy with a lot of affection.</p><p>Lee Yi Kyung played a sassy flirt who fits the role so well and is actually so humorous that I think their scenes together had such a delightful synergy that holding back laughter was the goal.</p><p>I consider Song Ha Yoon a talented actress due to her striking resemblance to Jung Soomin, coupled with a high level of synchronization and passion in her performances.</p><p><img alt="Park Min Young: courtesy of Studio Dragon" title="Park Min Young: courtesy of Studio Dragon" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-02/1707831331_park-min-young-4.jpg></p><p><strong>Kang Jiwon has different personalities- timid and fierce. How did you try to channel both of them differently? Are you any similar to Yang Jiwon?</strong></p><p>First of all, for the viewers to enjoy the drama, they need to be emotionally invested in it from the very beginning. Therefore, I deliberately restrained myself a little from portraying Kang Ji-won's time as a cancer patient. This involved external changes, such as dieting, and internal changes, creating empty eyes that could represent the fleetingness of life. After the return, I made an effort to infuse the timidity of the original support with a certain confidence and energy that only a second life can have. I hope that the difference will be noticeable.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>For me, there wasn't much similarity with the character, because it was a timid, dependent, and victimized character that I hadn't played before, so I wanted my character to be stronger, and I thought, "Come on, let's get gratifying revenge."</p><p><strong>What is your goal for 2024? What roles are you planning to take on?</strong></p><p>I'd like to do something with physical action before I get too old because I've done a lot of romance.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","EXCLUSIVE: Park Min Young on first impressions of Marry My Husband’s Na In Woo, Lee Yi Kyung and Song Ha Yoon",1278442,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusive-marry-my-husbands-na-in-woo-on-relationship-with-park-min-young-warning-to-lee-yi-kyungs-character-1276182","articlepage","/entertainment/exclusive-park-min-young-on-first-impressions-of-marry-my-husbands-na-in-woo-lee-yi-kyung-and-song-ha-yoon-1278442","Content Also read","entertainment","NA"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","EXCLUSIVE: Park Min Young on first impressions of Marry My Husband’s Na In Woo, Lee Yi Kyung and Song Ha Yoon",1278442,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusive-marry-my-husbands-na-in-woo-on-relationship-with-park-min-young-warning-to-lee-yi-kyungs-character-1276182","articlepage","/entertainment/exclusive-park-min-young-on-first-impressions-of-marry-my-husbands-na-in-woo-lee-yi-kyung-and-song-ha-yoon-1278442","EXCLUSIVE: Marry My Husband’s Na In Woo on relationship with Park Min Young, warning to Lee Yi Kyung’s character","Also_Read","entertainment","NA")'><strong>EXCLUSIVE: Marry My Husband’s Na In Woo on relationship with Park Min Young, warning to Lee Yi Kyung’s character</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5rFpLjUrKCvnV2lrrO3jKagp2WppMKvs4yopWaemafAtXnIpqernaOotrC60mamn2Wdlr%2BzxYymsGagpaivorrDrGSnmV2eu27DzqhkpZ2VYsaqecqyrKefXZa7pXnSqKWgZZiWerq7zqdkampnbYF1fg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fexclusive-park-min-young-on-first-impressions-of-marry-my-husbands-na-in-woo-lee-yi-kyung-and-song-ha-yoon-1278442.html&text=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Park%20Min%20Young%20on%20first%20impressions%20of%20Marry%20My%20Husbands%20Na%20In%20Woo%2c%20Lee%20Yi%20Kyung%20and%20S&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexclusive-park-min-young-on-first-impressions-of-marry-my-husbands-na-in-woo-lee-yi-kyung-and-song-ha-yoon-1278442.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-park-min-young-on-first-impressions-of-marry-my-husbands-na-in-woo-lee-yi-kyung-and-song-ha-yoon-1278442.html&title=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Park%20Min%20Young%20on%20first%20impressions%20of%20Marry%20My%20Husbands%20Na%20In%20Woo%2c%20Lee%20Yi%20Kyung%20and%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fexclusive-park-min-young-on-first-impressions-of-marry-my-husbands-na-in-woo-lee-yi-kyung-and-song-ha-yoon-1278442.html&title=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Park%20Min%20Young%20on%20first%20impressions%20of%20Marry%20My%20Husbands%20Na%20In%20Woo%2c%20Lee%20Yi%20Kyung%20and%20S" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-park-min-young-on-first-impressions-of-marry-my-husbands-na-in-woo-lee-yi-kyung-and-song-ha-yoon-1278442.html&title=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Park%20Min%20Young%20on%20first%20impressions%20of%20Marry%20My%20Husbands%20Na%20In%20Woo%2c%20Lee%20Yi%20Kyung%20and%20S" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexclusive-park-min-young-on-first-impressions-of-marry-my-husbands-na-in-woo-lee-yi-kyung-and-song-ha-yoon-1278442.html&description=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Park%20Min%20Young%20on%20first%20impressions%20of%20Marry%20My%20Husbands%20Na%20In%20Woo%2c%20Lee%20Yi%20Kyung%20and%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fran-drescher-opens-up-about-how-cannabis-has-helped-her-health.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fran Drescher Opens Up About How Cannabis Has Helped Her Health: I Now Understand Its Medicinal A">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./zelda-fitzgerald.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zelda Fitzgerald - Bio, Career, Married, Net Worth, Height, Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
