In fact, he changed his name based on a local street. Rita spent her childhood in a Greek Orthodox environment and this certainly had a deep impact on her.</p><h2>Rita Wilson's Career</h2><p>Wilson made her acting debut with a guest appearance on The Brady Bunch in the 1972 episode Greg's Triangle.&nbsp;She is more renowned for appearing in films such as&nbsp;Sleepless in Seattle (1993), Now and Then (1995), Jingle All the Way (1996), The Story of Us (1999) and Runaway Bride (1999).</p><p>Meanwhile, Wilson's interest in singing led her to record a debut solo album, AM/FM.

They subsequently divorced in 1987.</p><p>Earlier, Hanks met Wilson in the set of TV comedy series Bosom Buddies which ran from 1980 to 1982. They got reunited on the set of Volunteers in 1985.</p><p>Hanks claimed he felt an immediate spark when they were working together on the set of Volunteers. He said:</p><p>"Rita and I just looked at each other and — kaboing — that was that. I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn’t be denied."</p><p>The pair began dating after Hank's divorce. Tom revealed he was not ready to take on the responsibilities of his first marriage, citing the reason for the demise of their relationship.</p><p>Speaking to Oprah Winfrey in 2016, Tom revealed:</p><p>"The success of our relationship was a matter of timing, maturity and our willingness to have an intimate connection."</p><p>In 1993, the pair was seen together&nbsp;in the big screen, in a film titled Sleepless in Seattle. However, they played best friends rather than a couple.</p><p>Following his second consecutive Oscar win in 1995, Hanks credited his connection with Rita for his iconic onscreen performance in Forrest Gump.</p><p>In 1998, the couple came together for the actor’s hand imprint ceremony in front of the Mann’s Chinese Theater. Moreover, in a rare public appearance in 2004, the entire family, including their kids Chet and Truman went to a baseball game between the LA Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals.</p><p>Rita is really inspired to do charity work as she&nbsp;contributed to the Moffitt Cancer Center by donating "True Hearts" jewelry made of sterling silver and 14k gold.&nbsp;</p><p>In April 2015, Wilson announced she was diagnosed with breast cancer. This led to her undergoing a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. However, she made a full recovery thanks to an early diagnosis.</p><h2>Rita Wilson's Net Worth</h2><p>Rita Wilson has an estimated net worth of $20 million. Her source of income includes her salary and earnings through her acting career, as a producer as well as her singing career. Her house in Los Angeles is estimated to be worth $4.5 million.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rita's husband Hanks has a net worth estimated to be $350 million. For over four decades, he has enjoyed nearly 45 major leading roles in film, TV, and theatre.</p><p>In particular, 1994’s Forest Gump landed $60 million for Hanks and $678 million worldwide. Meanwhile, his car collections include Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Chevy Tahoe, and Toyota Prius.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK571qKiomeinsGiedaio6ynng%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frita-wilson.html&text=Rita%20Wilson%20Biography&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frita-wilson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frita-wilson.html&title=Rita%20Wilson%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frita-wilson.html&title=Rita%20Wilson%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frita-wilson.html&title=Rita%20Wilson%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frita-wilson.html&description=Rita%20Wilson%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kumamon-the-new-science-of-cute.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The new science of cute | Japan">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./page.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="how to make whippedcream">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
