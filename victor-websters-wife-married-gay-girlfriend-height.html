However, there is much more to him than just being an actor; we can learn even more about him by looking at his wife/married gay girlfriend as well as his height.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Before delving into that information though let’s review some facts about the star: he has been in multiple television shows and films throughout the years and continues to make waves in Hollywood with each new role!</p><p>Webster was born on February 7 1973 in Calgary Alberta to Roswitha (a hairdresser) and John (“Jack”) Webster (a policeman). Although he had a normal childhood Jack got into some trouble as a teenager. To find an alternative outlet for his energy and creativity Jack began taking martial arts lessons. His aptitude for the sport was such that he eventually became an instructor himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Victor-Webster-640x346.jpg><p>Becoming an actor was not his first career path it was even quite far from it. He first worked as a stockbroker in import/export.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Anna Kendrick’s Relationship Status; Single, Taken Or Married</a></strong></p><p>He started acting in the late ’90s and really got his foot in the door when he got the role of Nicholas Alamain on the ABC daytime soap Days of Our Lives.</p><p>He is of very mixed descent and you bet it shows that the star has Italian Spanish German French English and Scottish blood flowing through its veins. Being an exceptional actor is not his only great achievement he also holds an unbeaten record as a heavyweight in both the Tae Kwon Do competition and amateur kickboxing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Victor-Webster-2.jpg><p>As much as we wish we could get on with the star it’s time to start with the theme let’s start with the theme of Victor Webster’s wife.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Victor Webster’s Wife/Married</strong></h2><p>Before we begin with the theme of Victor Webster’s wife note that the star does not really have a wife. If we have something to say it is that this celebrity is as private as she comes. The information about him out there is quite condensed and you have to dig quite a bit to get out even with half a piece of information about this star. After a long dig, it turns out that the star is not married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Victor-Webster-3.jpg><p>There is no evidence anywhere that he had such a relationship with anyone and the next thing he came closest to marriage was when he married Phoebe Halliwell (portrayed by Alyssa Milano) in the successful television series Charmed. That’s good news for the ladies out there who may be hoping to attract his attention as the star is pretty much still on the market for a “woman”.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>George Clooney’s Wife, Sister, And Girlfriends</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Victor Webster Gay/Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>Although he has done his best to keep his private life under lock and key a few small facts about him have slipped through the cracks. The star is clearly heterosexual as he only had relationships with members of the opposite sex. If there are any homosexual encounters in his closet he has kept them pretty much there over the years. Finally, I would like to say that the star is open to women and we have a little something to prove it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Victor-Webster’s-wife-1.jpg><p>In 2009 the star was associated with Katrina Darrell who most of you will remember as American Idols Bikini Girl. It was great news when the two were seen on a sushi date actually intimate details about the relationship. Before that, he was connected to Krista Allen in 1999. In addition, he was associated with Katie Cleary and Monica Hansen in 2005.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Victor Webster’s Height</strong></h2><p>It is clear to all see that the star is very large and we have the numbers to prove it. Victor Webster’s height is 6 feet 3 inches and also weighs 97 kilograms. That’s all we have on the very interesting subject of Victor Webster’s wife married gay girlfriend and height in case there’s any more interesting information about this star you’ll be the first to know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts About Victor Webster</strong></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=1.5><tr><th>Date of Birth:</th><td><span class="value birthday">7 February 1973</span></td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-adjust"></i>&nbsp;Age:</th><td>47 years old</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></i>&nbsp;Birth Nation:</th><td>Canada</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-tower"></i>&nbsp;Height:</th><td>6 Feet 3 Inch</td></tr><tr><th>Name</th><td>Victor Webster</td></tr><tr><th>Father</th><td>Roswitha Webster</td></tr><tr><th>Mother</th><td>John Webster</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>Canadian</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place/City</th><td>Alberta</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity</th><td>White</td></tr><tr><th>Profession</th><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><th>Working For</th><td>NBC</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$1 million</td></tr><tr><th>Affair with</th><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th>Boyfriend</th><td>N/A</td></tr><tr readability=3><th>Education</th><td>Saddleback College, San Clemente High School</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kw6qv06ipZq%2BVl8C1sdGsZLChlpp6rq3Rq6CenF2crrp5xqKppZ6inrKvsIyhnKKfmKl8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fvictor-websters-wife-married-gay-girlfriend-height.html&text=Victor%20Websters%20Wife%2c%20Married%2c%20Gay%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvictor-websters-wife-married-gay-girlfriend-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvictor-websters-wife-married-gay-girlfriend-height.html&title=Victor%20Websters%20Wife%2c%20Married%2c%20Gay%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fvictor-websters-wife-married-gay-girlfriend-height.html&title=Victor%20Websters%20Wife%2c%20Married%2c%20Gay%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fvictor-websters-wife-married-gay-girlfriend-height.html&title=Victor%20Websters%20Wife%2c%20Married%2c%20Gay%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvictor-websters-wife-married-gay-girlfriend-height.html&description=Victor%20Websters%20Wife%2c%20Married%2c%20Gay%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-char-siu-old-hong-kongs-classic-comfort-food-and-how.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why char siu is old Hong Kongs classic comfort food  and how top Michelin-starred chefs are ke">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./luke-james-girlfriend-parents-daughter-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="R&amp;amp;B Artist, Luke James: Relationships, Gay Rumors, and Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
