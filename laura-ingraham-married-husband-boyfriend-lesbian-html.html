Laura has been associated with several news broadcasts and talk show events that helped her grow even further.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>You Can Also Read:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Fox News' Lauren Blanchard Wiki, Age, Married, Husband, Family</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Laura’s yearly salary is calculated at around $15 million. She is working in the Fox News Program,&nbsp;The Ingraham Angle, since October 2017. Laura got her to wish granted by Fox when the broadcast green singled her show Just In for a three-week trial in 2008.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Laura Ingraham from Conservative Political Action Conference at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center on 23 February 2018 in National Harbor, Maryland (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">gettyimages.com</a>)</p><p style=text-align:justify>The millionaire news anchor's earnings also reprise from her work with the CBS Network and&nbsp;MSNBC’s show Watch It.

She claimed that Laura became violent towards her and fired her on the&nbsp;first day of maternity leave. At that time, she was pregnant with a baby. She even stated- <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>“I had no lunch breaks. I pumped when I found a minute, here and there, making sure I wasn’t interfering with anything that was on the schedule,”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Though Laura didn't comment over the allegation, her attorney,&nbsp;Betty S.W. Graumlich, denied the allegations. In the email statement, her attorney wrote that Karolina's claims were without merit. He stated;</p><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;“Ms. Wilson’s claims are wholly without merit as our filed defenses to the Complaint make abundantly clear. We look forward to litigating this case vigorously.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Wilson&nbsp;worked as her assistant&nbsp;for over 16 months. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Ingraham Shows Concern For President Trump &nbsp;</h2><p>After President Trump was rushed to Walter Reed Medical Centre by helicopter from the White House, Laura got emotional and said on Friday news (2 October 2020) that America&nbsp;is praying for Trump's speedy recovery from the coronavirus. She noted that it was excruciating for her to watch Trump board Marine One for the medical center trip.</p><p>Moreover, she added that President Trump is not Catholic, but today (2 October 2020) is the Feast of the Guardian Angels, and everybody is praying for his recovery. The angels are watching over him (Trump). Laura's concern for Trump is of no surprise as they share a friendship of 20 years.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also did not back away from praising President for the work he has done for the country.

Ted, a Taiwan immigrant, scorned Laura for her racist remark and posted a Twitter reply on 9 August 2018 and wrote,</p><p style=text-align:justify>Dear Laura Ingraham: I served on active duty to defend your right to make racist statements.</p><p style=text-align:justify>America is not a race or demographic.
