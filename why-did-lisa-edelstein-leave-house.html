Her romantic affair with Hugh Laurie’s character, Dr.&nbsp;House, a genius doctor and the Head of Diagnostic&nbsp;Medicine&nbsp;at the New Jersey Hospital, also created a lot of buzz around the show.</p><p>And while both were charismatic and gifted, Dr.&nbsp;House&nbsp;was a proud pain medication addict who only worked on cases that interested him.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, the two were referred to as Huddy, and they kept the audience engaged with their on-and-off relationship. However, towards the end of season 7, it came as a shock to everyone that Lisa would not return for the final&nbsp;eighth season&nbsp;of the series.&nbsp;</p><p>This was surprising as Lisa was a fan favorite and her charismatic performance was one of the reasons the show had become so successful.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened in the Show?</h2><p>The relationship between Cuddy and&nbsp;House&nbsp;was filled with drama and troubles. Cuddy was adamant that House must stop taking his pain medication to be with her.</p><p>At some point, she even got engaged to another person while&nbsp;House&nbsp;fought to fully overcome his addiction with pain killers.&nbsp;</p><p>During the episode “Bombshells’ in season 7, things suddenly took a turn when Cuddy found out that she had a benign tumor. She later realized that&nbsp;House&nbsp;had resorted to pain medication to help him support her, so she broke up with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;House&nbsp;did not take the break up nicely, and in the final episode of the&nbsp;seventh season, he drove his car through her House.</p><p>Consequently, this act angered Cuddy so much that she resigned from her work and moved on, while&nbsp;House&nbsp;was imprisoned for his misconduct. In season 8, Cuddy did not return to the show, leaving their&nbsp;relationship unresolved.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Really Prompted Lisa to Leave&nbsp;House?</h2><p>It’s in the public domain that&nbsp;House&nbsp;was initially planned to run for seven seasons. This means that Lisa’s contract was expiring at the end of the 7th season. However, the show’s directors felt a need for one more season to finish the story better.&nbsp;</p><p>Since this extra season had not been planned initially, it would run on a&nbsp;limited budget, meaning Lisa and her counterparts had to take pay cuts.</p><p>During the new contract negotiations, things didn’t work well between Lisa and the management, as they couldn’t agree on an offer suitable for both parties.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, Lisa decided to cut all ties with the show. Many fans believe she did not leave on a good note, which could explain why she is the only&nbsp;cast&nbsp;member that didn’t make a cameo in the last season.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TV Line</a>&nbsp;after departing&nbsp;House, Lisa said that making the show’s decision was sad, disappointing, and challenging.</p><p>However, she felt that leaving the show was the best course of action for her and her business. She did not harbor any regrets for the decision she had made.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Has Lisa Done After Leaving House?</h2><p>Having been in the show for seven&nbsp;seasons&nbsp;as a&nbsp;major character, Lisa must have wondered how it would feel getting out there and playing other roles. And so she didn’t waste time before getting back on the screen.</p><p>She started with playing a role in&nbsp;The Good Wife, which ran for three seasons. In 2013, she took a voice role with the popular animation show,&nbsp;The Legend of Korra.</p><p>From 2014 to 2018, she became the main protagonist in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bravo’s Girlfriends’ Guide to Divorce</a>, which focuses on divorced women. And she was not about to stop, as in 2018, she got a recurring role in the medical drama,&nbsp;The Good Doctor.&nbsp;</p><p>Other notable mentions she has played in include the Netflix show’s&nbsp;The Kominsky Method, and she is also expected to feature in the 2021 Fox series&nbsp;9-1-1: Lone Star&nbsp;as the ex-wife to Owen Strand.&nbsp;</p><p>Lisa is a testament that nothing can stop a determined woman as she has also immersed herself in the world of directing. She directed an entire episode in the series&nbsp;Girlfriends’ Guide to Divorce&nbsp;and two other short films in&nbsp;Unzipping&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lulu.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Takeaway</h2><p>When Lisa announced that she would be leaving&nbsp;House, many people thought that she was making a big mistake in her career. She was a big star, and the show was doing exceptionally well with millions of followers worldwide.</p><p>Looking back at that decision now, it’s safe to say that it has not negatively impacted her career.&nbsp;</p><p>She is now more appreciated as an actor that can play different roles, and she has also taken up directing roles. As her fans, we can only wish her the best and hope she continues to bless our screens with her gifts for many more years to come.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCpYrGqsIyloKyZXZqxprjSrZyipl2hsqLCxGafqK2jmnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-lisa-edelstein-leave-house.html&text=The%20Main%20Reason%20Lisa%20Edelstein%20Left%20House&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-lisa-edelstein-leave-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-lisa-edelstein-leave-house.html&title=The%20Main%20Reason%20Lisa%20Edelstein%20Left%20House" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-did-lisa-edelstein-leave-house.html&title=The%20Main%20Reason%20Lisa%20Edelstein%20Left%20House" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-lisa-edelstein-leave-house.html&title=The%20Main%20Reason%20Lisa%20Edelstein%20Left%20House" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-lisa-edelstein-leave-house.html&description=The%20Main%20Reason%20Lisa%20Edelstein%20Left%20House" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-richard-mille-watches-are-billionaires-handshake-swiss-luxury-timepiece-brand-has-become-symbol.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Richard Mille watches are the billionaires handshake: the Swiss luxury timepiece brand ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./best-apps-sharing-mouse-and-keyboard-across-computers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 6 Best Apps for Sharing a Mouse and Keyboard Across Multiple Computers">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
