Coming to blows in the explosive season finale, the Harlan Coben drama finally revealed who killed Joe Burkett – and fans have been left "speechless" on social media. For those of you who haven't tuned in yet, Fool Me Once follows Maya Stern, played by <a class=hm-link href=#>Michelle Keegan</a>. Newly widowed, the former military captain and mum-of-one finds herself at the centre of a spine-chilling conspiracy.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Fool Me Once - trailer</figure><p id=eDbpBbuU-eG data-wc=65>After witnessing the murder of her beloved husband, Joe Burkett (<a class=hm-link href=#>Richard Armitage</a>), a grieving Maya is shocked to discover footage of him – alive and well – on a secret nanny cam in their home. Conducting her own investigation, Maya quickly learns that Joe's death is part of a disturbingly tangled web, and it's also connected to the unsolved murder of her beloved sister, Claire.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewdosW7d9WG data-wc=17>So, what happened? Keep reading for a recap of the season finale. But warning – spoilers ahead.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Fool Me Once's ending explained</h2><h3 dir=ltr>Who killed Joe Burkett?</h3><p id=eSXc_9wUje1 data-wc=55>The season finale picks up moments after Maya's shocking confession – she killed Joe, with a gun, in the park – dum, dum, dum! After following our girl (pun intended) for seven episodes, and believing her to be as clueless as the rest of us, it turned out that we'd all been played for fools.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/66beb3370455-fmo101unit00725rt-1.jpg><p id=eLIb16pZChY data-wc=45>In spite of the mysterious nanny cam footage, Maya had been adamant that Joe was dead from day one, and now we know why. In a shocking twist, it's revealed that she'd planned the murder, after suspecting that her husband was behind Claire's brutal execution.&nbsp;</p><p id=el3Dq9YiLK_ data-wc=74>Failing to believe that Claire had been shot in a random break-in at her home, Maya had returned home from the army, putting her detective skills to use. With the help of her military police pal, Shane, Maya quickly learned that the bullet that shot Claire was an exact match for the handgun that she keeps at home. Stored in a high-security safe, Joe was the only other person who could have accessed it.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/24fa70260f83-dsc2543rt.jpg><p id=eb2o9zbw4Sx data-wc=51>Hoping he'd prove her wrong, Maya called Joe and told him she knew what he'd done. After luring him to their spot in the park, Maya confronted him about the murder, which Joe initially denied, but in a final attempt to force his hand, Maya threatened to go to the police.&nbsp;</p><p id=elL7Hgv16Iw data-wc=62>Pulling a gun on his own wife, Joe pulled the trigger, but it was Maya who had the upper hand. Before the meeting, Maya had swapped the handgun in her safe, for a deactivated one. That way, if Joe attempted to shoot her – thus proving he was the killer – she could protect herself and return home to their daughter, Lily.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/ee6df65fa414-maya-and-joe-fool-me-once.jpg><p id=eOjERnRwNZn data-wc=44>Exacting her revenge, Maya shot Joe three times that night, before covering herself in his blood and calling for help. The only problem with her plan? Rambo – a handbag thief operating in the park with his pal PJ – had witnessed the murder.&nbsp;</p><p id=etk6kEqwk6K data-wc=57>After recalling her plan, a shell-shocked Shane helps Maya out one last time. Driving Isabella, and her boyfriend, Tuka – who were behind the deep-faked video of Joe on the nanny cam – away from the car park where she'd held them at gunpoint, he drops them on a main road and tells them to walk home.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/7bb34a107f68-michelle-keegan-joanna-lumley-fool-me-once.jpg><p id=eP_xzsrDUPT data-wc=33>Maya, now aware that Joe's mother, Judith (Joanna Lumley), had asked Isabella and Tuka to fake the footage, returns home where she cleans herself up and writes a letter to her daughter Lily.&nbsp;</p><p id=eM9kewtEp6C data-wc=56>Meanwhile, acting on a tip from PJ, DS Sami Kierce (played by Adeel Akhtar) manages to track down Rambo. After learning what happened in the park, he heads to Maya's house where he arrests her. After confessing, Maya pleads with Kierce to give her a shot, so that she can finally bring down the Burkett family.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><h3 dir=ltr>Why did Joe Burkett kill Maya's sister Claire Walker?</h3><p id=ehBoWqK4A-dT data-wc=43>In a bid to stop whistleblower Corey Rudzinzki from publishing the audio of a military blunder made by Maya, Claire had struck up a deal with him – she'd uncover the corruption in the Burkett family if Corey promised to leave Maya alone.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/33e467fdc179-joe-burkett-fool-me-once.jpg><p id=eeuoDJewYh42 data-wc=41>What Claire found, however, was way worse than she could have imagined.
