Adam, vice president at a New York City real estate development firm, was about to leave when Kimmy Scotti, friend of a mutual friend, arrived. “Kimmy waltzed in and said hello to my friends,” says Adam. “Her smile and her energy instantly gave me confidence.

He chose her 33rd birthday party in May 2018, surrounded by friends and family who had flown in for the event, which they hosted at their Flatiron loft. He had clued in the guests that he planned to propose, and when they were ushered out onto the private roof terrace, Kimmy was the only one in the dark. Adam, who had been a member of The Duke’s Men of Yale (now called the Doox of Yale) a capella group at his alma mater, rewrote the lyrics to Kimmy’s favorite song, Talking Head’s This Must Be the Place, to reflect her and their relationship. At the final verse, he got down on one knee and proposed.</p><img alt="Photograph, White, Black, Black-and-white, Bride, Wedding, Dress, Ceremony, Monochrome photography, Snapshot, " title="Photograph, White, Black, Black-and-white, Bride, Wedding, Dress, Ceremony, Monochrome photography, Snapshot, " width=1440 height=960 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-real-wedding-halloween-07-1572535702.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Belathee</span></p><img alt="Photograph, White, Dress, Gown, Wedding dress, Clothing, Bride, Bridal clothing, Photography, Shoulder, " title="Photograph, White, Dress, Gown, Wedding dress, Clothing, Bride, Bridal clothing, Photography, Shoulder, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-real-weddings-halloween-first-look-1572536347.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Belathee</span></p><img alt="Bride, Photograph, Wedding dress, Ceremony, Wedding, Bridal clothing, Dress, Marriage, Gown, Formal wear, " title="Bride, Photograph, Wedding dress, Ceremony, Wedding, Bridal clothing, Dress, Marriage, Gown, Formal wear, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-real-wedding-halloween-09-1572535731.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Belathee</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was a question of how was I going to do this and really make a splash and have some fun—and create a moment that she's going remember fondly forever.

The tails felt right and fit like a glove, he says. “It was traditional enough for the synagogue but also was a hint of what was to come in the 24 hours to follow that wedding.

Both of us in eight-foot tall wings walking from The Bowery Hotel to the venue on the Lower East Side because of the insane Halloween parade traffic was one of my favorite parts of the night. Little kids kept stopping us and asking ‘What are you?’ and I would tell them ‘A bride!’ and then they would turn to their parents and say “I want to be a bride next year!’,” says Kimmy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kimmy began the evening with an Oscar de la Renta matching short-sleeve crop top and floor length skirt of white tulle and silver sequins and mirrors.

She had been at a tech conference in London in June 2018 where she met Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri and CMO Robert Triefus. She happened to be dressed completely in Gucci at the time, making quite an impression in a sea of hoodies. Triefus extended an invitation to the Gucci boutique in Milan, where Adam had already decided to select his wedding outfit. While Adam was being fitted for his tails, she was treated to a display of Gucci’s dress collection. “I walked into this beautiful room and they pulled all of these white dresses and pieces from the archive they thought I would like, and told me they would make anything in white for me. I ended up with a custom third gown; it was such a great experience because I got to go back to Milan a couple of times for fittings and to pick the dress up. They just looked after me so well each time—and ruined my wedding diet with a lot of pasta," jokes Kimmy.</p><img alt="Red, Event, Photography, Art, " title="Red, Event, Photography, Art, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-real-weddings-halloween-entertainment-1572537735.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Belathee</span></p><img alt="Red, Event, Ceremony, Bride, Wedding, Dress, Photography, Floral design, Tradition, " title="Red, Event, Ceremony, Bride, Wedding, Dress, Photography, Floral design, Tradition, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-real-wedding-halloween-04-1572537759.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Belathee</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=64 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She selected a full length gown with a detachable cape from the Gucci archive, which Gucci custom made for her in cream silk.

Once the doors were closed at 8.30 sharp, they mounted the stage and performed an arrangement of one of Kimmy’s favorite songs, What a Good Boy by the Barenaked Ladies. Adam, who had been tucked away in a closet at the back of the stage for the entire 45 minutes during cocktails, made a dramatic entrance. “Adam came out of the doors in his wings and joined them on stage and sang with them. There's a part of the song that’s about a good girl’s character. While they were singing, I appeared at the back of the room and it was such a fun thing to do, walk through this crowd of all of our friends and family who were so shocked to see us in these wings and crystals,” says Kimmy.</p><img alt="Red, Event, Fun, Performance, Formal wear, Costume, Music venue, Gesture, " title="Red, Event, Fun, Performance, Formal wear, Costume, Music venue, Gesture, " width=1440 height=2158 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/a-k172-1572538224.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Belathee</span></p><img alt="White, Photograph, Black-and-white, Fashion, Beauty, Monochrome photography, Monochrome, Dress, Outerwear, Photography, " title="White, Photograph, Black-and-white, Fashion, Beauty, Monochrome photography, Monochrome, Dress, Outerwear, Photography, " width=1440 height=960 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-real-wedding-halloween-02-1572537832.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Belathee</span></p><img alt="White, Black, Black-and-white, Monochrome, Black hair, Monochrome photography, Lip, Cool, Photography, Style, " title="White, Black, Black-and-white, Monochrome, Black hair, Monochrome photography, Lip, Cool, Photography, Style, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-real-wedding-halloween-36-1572537807.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Belathee</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=70 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The color scheme was romantic and moody with rich reds, purples, and fuchsia, accented with greenery and sprawling displays of fruit.

The interior was whimsical and nostalgic: funfetti and Oreo cream icing. “The cake really looked serious from the outside, but the inside was so playful,” says Kimmy.</p><img alt="Performance, Event, Stage, Performing arts, Human body, Performance art, Concert, Hand, Musician, Music venue, " title="Performance, Event, Stage, Performing arts, Human body, Performance art, Concert, Hand, Musician, Music venue, " width=1440 height=960 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/a-k379-1572538190.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Belathee</span></p><img alt="Red, Event, Ceremony, Fashion, Formal wear, Wedding, Dress, Fun, Suit, Marriage, " title="Red, Event, Ceremony, Fashion, Formal wear, Wedding, Dress, Fun, Suit, Marriage, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-real-wedding-halloween-35-1572537877.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Belathee</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=75 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The entertainment for the 330 guests included burlesque performers, a contortionist, a snake charmer, and a belly dancer with a live boa constrictor, as well as astrology, tarot card, and palm readings held in private nooks.
