Even today at the end of the 70s the actress and singer has not lost her charm and still holds many hearts spellbound every time she appears.</p><p>Read on to learn more about Raquel Welch Bio, Spouse, Daughter, Net Worth, Kids, Age, Height, and Measurements</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Raquel Welch Bio, Age</strong></h2><p>Raquel Welch was born Jo Raquel Tejada on September 5 1940 in Chicago Illinois USA. Her father Armando Carlos Tejada Urquizo (1911-1976) was a Bolivian immigrant who worked as an aeronautical engineer while her mother Josephine Sarah Hall (1909-2000) was of English origin. She is the first of three children including her younger brother James “Jim” Stanford and her younger sister Gayle Carole.</p><p>Two years after her birth her family moved to San Diego California where she regularly attended Pacific Beach Presbyterian Church with her mother. As she grew up she was very athletic entered beauty contests and rose very high in her studies. She aspired to become a ballet dancer but gave up her dreams after 10 years of intense practice when her teacher told her she didn’t have the right figure.</p><p>At the age of 14, she won the titles of Miss Photogenic and Miss Contour as well as Miss La Jolla in high school and Miss San Diego – the most beautiful of the Fair – at the San Diego County Fair. With her impressive resume in the beauty contest arena, Raquel finally won the state title of Maid of California.</p><p>Unfortunately, her parents divorced shortly after she graduated. She graduated with honors from La Jolla High School in 1958 after which she enrolled at San Diego State College on a theatre arts scholarship to pursue a career as an actress. She then joined a local theatre where she played several roles in their productions such as the lead role in The Ramona Pageant in 1959 the same year she married James Welch.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Bridget Moynahan Bio, Son, Net Worth, Husband, Age, Height, Tom Brady</a></strong></p><p>To advance in the show business arena, Welch has accepted a position as a weather forecaster at a local television station in San Diego KFMB. She also worked as a model in Dallas Texas for Neiman Marcus and as a cocktail waitress before moving to Los Angeles in 1963.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Acting Career</strong></h2><p>In Los Angeles, she met Patrick Curtis who became her personal and commercial director after applying for roles in film studios. Curtis had the idea of promoting her as a sexual symbol and also convinced her to use her husband’s last name to avoid typecasting in Latin. Over time she began to win roles first in A House Is Not a Home (1964) and then in an Elvis Presley film Roustabout (1964).</p><p>This is followed by small-screen roles such as Envoûtement McHale’s Navy and The Virginian as well as a presentation concert as part of the weekly variety series The Hollywood Palace. In 1965 she wrote her first feature film in the beach film A Swingin’ Summer. After playing a leading role in the science fiction film Fantastic Voyage (1966) which became a success and put it on the star map she signed a contract with 20th Century Fox and other films followed. However it is One Million B.C. (1966) where she had only one suit an oxskin bikini and only three lines that brought Curtis’ initial idea to life-changing her status to have a sex appeal.</p><p>In the years that followed she had a myriad of roles in films some outside the United States such as in Italy and Spain. Her works include The Oldest Profession (1967) Fathom (1967) Bedazzled (1967) Bandolero! (1968) where she avoided a sexy role. Although she has starred in a variety of other films starring such great names as Frank Sinatra in Lady in Cement (1968) and Burt Reynolds in The Western 100 Rifles in 1969 Raquel wanted to be taken seriously as an actress.</p><p>She took the risk in 1970 when she played a transsexual heroine in the controversial film Myra Breckinridge co-starring Mae West. Although the film was a failure Playboy nicknamed her the most desired woman of the 70s.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a class=mentionable href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-mentionable=786>Sally Field Bio, Age, Death, Net Worth, Children, Height, Married, Husband</a></strong></p><p>From 1982 she had more small-screen roles until 1994 when she starred in the feature film Naked Gun 33.
