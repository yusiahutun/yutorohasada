He promised to deliver "the old stuff" — he knows what the people want — and he bounced&nbsp;around&nbsp;decades, at times seeming&nbsp;to take requests from signs in the crowd.</p><p>Perhaps the most hospitable entertainer in country music, perhaps all of music — Brooks worked hard to make each section of the crowd feel his love, throwing out&nbsp;more "heart hand" signs in one evening than <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> has in her lifetime. Though he was short two band members due to COVID-19, including a guitarist (promising opener and songwriter Mitch Rossell filled in nicely), the 60-year-old Brooks brought his A-game.</p><p>Racing across the stage better than artists 30 years his junior, he was even hard to keep up with at times, with an in-the-round stage set designed so he could face&nbsp;any corner of the room at any time, making the venue — an NFL stadium — feel almost intimate.</p><p>"Two Pina Coladas" and "I Will Sail My Vessel"&nbsp;became&nbsp;full-on singalongs,&nbsp;as did&nbsp;covers of "Amarillo by Morning" by Texan <a href=#>George Strait</a> (the crowd loved this) and Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's "Fishin' in the Dark." Brooks delivered two slow songs in a row (a big no-no, by his own admittance), but since they were "Unanswered Prayers" (a No. 1 hit in 1991) and "If Tomorrow Never Comes" (his first-ever No. 1 single, 1989), he was handsomely rewarded with cheers, rather than punished.</p><p>Brooks brings a large live band, a group of men and women — some of them Grammy winners, others Hall of Famers — he has long histories with, and it takes just as long to introduce them all, which he did across several songs ("Callin' Baton Rouge," "Shameless," crowd-favorite "Friends in Low Places").&nbsp;Between&nbsp;primal wails of glee,&nbsp;he thanked the "cats" who've made his career possible, including the fans themselves.</p><p>"Thank you for my life!" he remarked near what seemed to be the end of the show (it wasn't).</p><p>"Houston, Texas,"&nbsp;Brooks shouted,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;... something inaudible ... over the roar of the crowd.&nbsp;"YOU GUYS F--KING ROCK."</p><p>A lengthy encore of crowd&nbsp;requests would cap this eventful night — oh, and an appearance from his sequin-adorned wife <a href=#>Trisha Yearwood</a>,&nbsp;after a young&nbsp;man near the stage asked for Brooks to sing "Shallow" (the song, a Bradley Cooper/Lady Gaga duet from the 2018 remake of A Star Is Born,&nbsp;is one <a href=#>the country supercouple cut a studio version of</a> in 2020).&nbsp;</p><p>The proud husband then took the opportunity to make a "request" of his own, which led to Yearwood singing her 1991 hit "She's&nbsp;in Love With&nbsp;the Boy." This was another win with the crowd. She stuck around for Brooks' "Standing Outside the Fire" (1993), letting him wrap his show solo, with a number of covers (Doug Supernaw's "You Never Even Call Me&nbsp;by My Name," Don McLean's "American Pie," Billy Joel's "Piano Man"), pushing the full set time to over two hours.</p><p>Brooks acknowledged that the special night was "the close of a chapter for us," but of course, "when a chapter closes, a new one opens."&nbsp;Next up for&nbsp;the megastar&nbsp;is a five-show run of his Stadium Tour in Dublin, Ireland. He's been busy off-stage, too — on Tuesday (Aug. 9), it was announced that Brooks will&nbsp;<a href=#>narrate a new docuseries about America's national parks</a>, which he also executive produced.</p><p><strong>Garth Brooks Songs Ranked Worst to First:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJmiqbVurtGopqSrXajBorDIrqRmrJ%2Bqv260zq6qraeeYn9xfpFo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgarth-brooks-stadium-tour-houston-2022.html&text=Garth%20Brooks%20Caps%20Three-Year%20U.S.%20Stadium%20Tour%20in%20Houston&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgarth-brooks-stadium-tour-houston-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgarth-brooks-stadium-tour-houston-2022.html&title=Garth%20Brooks%20Caps%20Three-Year%20U.S.%20Stadium%20Tour%20in%20Houston" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgarth-brooks-stadium-tour-houston-2022.html&title=Garth%20Brooks%20Caps%20Three-Year%20U.S.%20Stadium%20Tour%20in%20Houston" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgarth-brooks-stadium-tour-houston-2022.html&title=Garth%20Brooks%20Caps%20Three-Year%20U.S.%20Stadium%20Tour%20in%20Houston" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgarth-brooks-stadium-tour-houston-2022.html&description=Garth%20Brooks%20Caps%20Three-Year%20U.S.%20Stadium%20Tour%20in%20Houston" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./maggie-rogers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maggie Rogers - Net Worth, Height, Bio, Career, In Relation, Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./carrie-ann-inaba-dressed-tomboy-after-childhood-molestation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carrie Ann Inaba Would Dress Uglier on Purpose to Deter Unwanted Attention After Being M">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
