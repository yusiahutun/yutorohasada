Shortly after his birth, his family moved to their hometown – Sacramento, California. Ryan grew up there.</p><p>According to Ryan, he never imagined becoming an actor or professional dancer. His interest as a child was in martial arts. The actor developed a passion for martial arts when he was just seven years old and received his first black belt at the age of ten in Tae Kwon Do. He even became a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter until his fighting license expired. That was in 2010.</p><p>Ryan Guzman played baseball in high school and was popular as a left-handed pitcher. He hoped to build a career as a baseball player, but then his dream was shattered by a shoulder injury. Guzman then found solace in print modeling. He worked at the LOOK Modeling Agency and later moved to Los Angeles in September 2010, where he joined the Wilhelmina Agency. While modeling for Abercrombie & Fitch, Affliction and Reebok, he appeared in television commercials for Old Navy, Gillette, Candies, and Oprah Winfrey Network.</p><p>The successes Guzman achieved in modeling inspired him to try his hand at acting.

My father was actually born in Mexico. He grew up there, and he came back and forth to America for pretty much his entire youth.
