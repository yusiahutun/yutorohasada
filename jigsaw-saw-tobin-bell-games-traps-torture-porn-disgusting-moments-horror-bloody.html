After the franchise took a box office nosedive with the release of "Saw VI," Lionsgate decided to end the series in 2010 with "Saw 3D: The Final Chapter," which took in a still-respectable $45 million haul against a $17 million budget.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:043a2bb7-abf4-55fd-b1ff-6181bb0f5184 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a0414a8b-27d2-5eb1-8ef0-3b246f938c22 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/37/5by4/2017/10/26/37939c8aadda5982a94859ae0e5b9425_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Samantha Bee Turns Climate Change Denier Into a Believer Through 'Hell House' of Global Warming Horror</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>After seven years away from the big screen, the serial killer, Billy the Puppet and those infamous traps were all resurrected for 2017's <strong><a href=#>"Jigsaw,"</a></strong> out Friday in theaters. The film is expected to rack up $20 million opening weekend.</p><p>In celebration of the gore-filled franchise's return, here are the 13 ickiest, nastiest and most memorable puzzles from the first seven films.</p><h2 class=h2>WARNING: Rube Goldberg machinery and graphic violence below.</h2><h2 class=h2>Lovers' Triangle (Saw 3D: The Final Chapter)</h2><p>This was one of the only traps in the series to play out in public, as a whole promenade full of people watched two men who were getting played by the same woman decide which one of them would live.</p><p>In the end, the guys made a clean break from Deena, which left her split in two.</p><h2 class=h2>The Coffin Trap (Saw V)</h2><p>After discovering Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) was secretly working with John Kramer, Special Agent Peter Strahm (Scott Patterson) was asked to prove he trusted Jigsaw by getting into a glass box filled with glass shards.</p><p>Instead, Strahm threw Hoffman into the box and the agent got pressed to death like a panini while Hoffman lived to see another day.</p><h2 class=h2>Razor Wire (Saw)</h2><p>After attempting suicide, this poor guy was tasked with proving whether he really wanted to live by squirming through a box full of barbed wire.</p><p>It didn't end well for him.</p><h2 class=h2>The Pendulum (Saw V)</h2><p>Seth Baxter never stood a chance. Hoffman placed Baxter into this nasty trap as punishment for murdering his sister, rigging it so he'd die even if he followed Jigsaw's directions to a T.</p><p>After crushing his own hands in an attempt to escape, he wasn't released and the pendulum above him brought his insides outside.</p><h2 class=h2>Classroom (Saw: III)</h2><p>Like Baxter, Troy was also placed into a trap he wouldn't be able to escape. Troy woke up in the middle of a classroom with chains attached to his arms, legs and, worst of all, lips, as a bomb ticked down next to him.</p><p>In theory, he'd be able to leave the room after pulling all the chains from his body, but the door was welded shut.</p><p>Boom goes the dynamite.</p><h2 class=h2>The Rack (Saw III)</h2><p>Jeff Denlon spent most of the third movie confronting people who played a role in his son's death. This clip was his third test, which saw his son's killer Timothy placed into a device that twisted all his limbs until they snapped.</p><p>Denlon didn't get the key in time, however, and Timothy's nasty death was a real pain in the arms, legs and neck.</p><h2 class=h2>Shotgun Roulette (Saw VI)</h2><p>Insurance agent William Easton -- who denied Kramer's request for cancer treatment -- also went through a series of tests in "Saw VI." This nifty little carousel tasked Easton with deciding which two of his six subordinates were worthy enough to keep living.</p><p>They all made their cases one by one, with four of them getting their heads blown up by the end of this twisted game.</p><h2 class=h2>Pound of Flesh (Saw IV)</h2><p>This trap was simple: the money lender who was able to cut the most flesh off their body in the time allotted would survive.</p><p>Simone won by an arm.</p><h2 class=h2>Fish Hook (Saw 3D: The Final Chapter)</h2><p>In "Saw 3D," Bobby Dagen is punished for faking and profiting off of a Jigsaw attack with a series of tests exposing everyone who played a role in his deceit. His publicist, Nina, definitely got it the worst, as a key to her survival was attached to a fish hook in her stomach.</p><p>After thoroughly slicing up her through, Dagen still didn't finish the mission in time and poor Nina's days as a PR gugu met a brutal end.</p><h2 class=h2>Angel Trap (Saw III)</h2><p>After surviving the first two movies, Detective Allison Kerry was ripped apart early on in "Saw III."</p><p>Following her kidnapping, Kerry woke up with a device attached to her ribcage. The key to her escape rested in a vat of acid, which she dutifully dipped her hands in to retrieve it. Though she totally annihilated her hands and undid the lock, this was another trap that actually had no escape route.</p><h2 class=h2>Reverse Bear Trap (Saw)</h2><p>While this one actually had a semi-happy ending for heroin addict Amanda Young, the reverse bear trap is, without a doubt, the most memorable device in the franchise. Young was able survive her test after retrieving the key inside a man's stomach.</p><p>The contraption reared its ugly head two more times in the series and was later used on Detective Hoffman -- who got half his jaw ripped off by it -- and Jigsaw's wife, Jill Tuck, who it killed.</p><h2 class=h2>Junkyard (Saw 3D: The Final Chapter)</h2><p>Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington, who committed suicide earlier this year, was a longtime fan of the franchise when he was invited by producer (and neighbor to one of his bandmates) Mark Burg to be part of the series' most intricate kills.</p><p>Bennington played a skinhead who had to literally rip the skin off his back to save three of his cohorts. Like most people in these films, he didn't complete his task in time, setting of a chain reaction that killed all four of them.</p><h2 class=h2>Bye, Bye Foot (Saw)</h2><p>The first cut is the deepest, right?</p><p>Nothing beats the shock of seeing Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) cut off his own foot in the original film. It was probably one of the simplest traps in the franchise, but still the most disturbing.</p><p>"Jigsaw" opens Friday, October 26. See a sneak peek at one of its sinister scenarios below.</p><a id=gallery-link-aaf1cbec-fd4d-51b5-b758-906174e7cb79 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:aaf1cbec-fd4d-51b5-b758-906174e7cb79 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20170929_651ad13bb9c9509e9b258b7d49d5f9cc data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:a0414a8b-27d2-5eb1-8ef0-3b246f938c22 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/65/4by3/2017/09/29/651ad13bb9c9509e9b258b7d49d5f9cc_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Everett Collection</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7kGlma29fn7aov8CwZKyZp2LBsK7Ip2SbnZyheqitzJ6qZqyilr20edOoqa2topp6sbvRp2SdoaOcwrTAyKeeZqWforKvwNJmn6iqoqS%2Fbq7LqKadsV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjigsaw-saw-tobin-bell-games-traps-torture-porn-disgusting-moments-horror-bloody.html&text=13%20Nastiest%20Jigsaw%20Traps%20That%20Cemented%20%27Saw%27%20Franchise%27s%20Torture%20Porn%20Legacy&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjigsaw-saw-tobin-bell-games-traps-torture-porn-disgusting-moments-horror-bloody.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjigsaw-saw-tobin-bell-games-traps-torture-porn-disgusting-moments-horror-bloody.html&title=13%20Nastiest%20Jigsaw%20Traps%20That%20Cemented%20%27Saw%27%20Franchise%27s%20Torture%20Porn%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjigsaw-saw-tobin-bell-games-traps-torture-porn-disgusting-moments-horror-bloody.html&title=13%20Nastiest%20Jigsaw%20Traps%20That%20Cemented%20%27Saw%27%20Franchise%27s%20Torture%20Porn%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjigsaw-saw-tobin-bell-games-traps-torture-porn-disgusting-moments-horror-bloody.html&title=13%20Nastiest%20Jigsaw%20Traps%20That%20Cemented%20%27Saw%27%20Franchise%27s%20Torture%20Porn%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjigsaw-saw-tobin-bell-games-traps-torture-porn-disgusting-moments-horror-bloody.html&description=13%20Nastiest%20Jigsaw%20Traps%20That%20Cemented%20%27Saw%27%20Franchise%27s%20Torture%20Porn%20Legacy" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./blake-garrett-rosenthal-wiki-biography-parents-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Blake Garrett Rosenthal Wiki Biography, Parents, Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ufc-star-posed-completely-naked-31397401.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="UFC 295 star posed naked with only her title belt covering her modesty">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
