Peter MacNeil is familiar with his performance in the ‘A History of Violence,' ‘Crash’ and ‘Frequency.' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-172 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Career and Progression:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Peter MacNeil started his acting career with a minor role in the movie, ‘Why Rock the Boat?’ in 1974. He further continued his journey with the projects such as, ‘Strange Shadows in an Empty Room,' ‘Kings and Desperate Men,' ‘Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future’ and ‘Sex & Mrs. X’.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Moreover, MacNeil established himself as a brilliant actor after his performance in ‘Crash’ in 1996. After ‘Crash,' he showed his acting competence in some outstanding movies and television series including ‘Above and Beyond,' ‘Something Beneath,' ‘Weird or What,' ‘Call Me Fitz’ and ‘Regression.'&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>He last appeared in the 2017 Canadian thriller movie directed by Aidan Shipley and Grayson Moore titled ‘Cardinals.'

His works in those projects make it evident that he has garnered enormous fortune to live a lavish lifestyle. The actual earnings of McNeil haven’t surfaced in the media so far, but considering his endeavors and decades-long works, he must have maintained his net worth in millions of dollars.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is Peter Secretly Married?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Peter MacNeil has portrayed the character of responsible family man in several movies. However, whether or not he is married and has a relationship to cherish remains a mystery. Neither has media encountered him appearing together with a wife nor has he publicly spoken about his relationship status and closed ones so far.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><p style=text-align:justify>But looking at his relentless silence, the audience often suspect that he might belong to gay orientation. It is not known if he is single or is married in secret and reluctant to share it with the media. Besides, the actor doesn’t even run a social media account to know about his whereabouts and other personal details.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Whatever might be the reason behind this, one thing is evident that his fans will keep on loving him and grace the theatres to see his magical performance.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>His Short Bio:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The ‘Frequency’ star, Peter was born in New Brunswick, Canada. Apart from that, the actor hasn’t revealed his birthday, and his age also remains under the wraps. But given his appearance and tenure in the industry, he must be somewhere around the sixties.
