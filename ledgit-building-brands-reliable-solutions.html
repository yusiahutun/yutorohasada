Because at the end of the day, digital transformation is such that it will not only take care of the survival of your business, but it will also open new avenues for your business to grow.&nbsp;</p><p>Featuring for the Cover Story of The Enterprise World’s The Best Digital & Business Solutions Providers in 2022 is Ledgit, a company that helps build brands with their reliable and transformative business solutions.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Company-</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Ledgit started off</a> as a blockchain solutions company focusing on provenance in the supply chain. To be able to track and trace the flow of the supply chain back to its origin to verify the authenticity was the main focus.&nbsp;</p><p>As they moved further into the blockchain industry, there were many companies facing difficulties in the digital presence. Ledgit came up with a solution, one which restructured with the mission of bringing “Digital Transformation” solutions to SMEs and start-ups throughout the ASEAN Region. By making Digital Transformation easily implemented and available to all enterprises.&nbsp;</p><p>“We also carried the vision to connect and establish a hub of strategic alliances from all over the globe to provide a wider range of expert solutions and achieve maximum efficiency for our partners and clients.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Overcoming the Challenges-</h3><p>The initial challenges that the company faced when we first started building Ledgit was that a lot of SMEs and start-ups in Malaysia were still not fond of the concept of <a href=#>Digital transformation</a> as most of them still choose to rely on traditional methods to run their business. As for Ledgit, they too found that there were too many digital tools and too many factors to be considered when transforming business in the digital world.&nbsp;</p><p>“We need to source for the best tools, talents as well as go through many trials and errors experiences to source out the best and most efficient way for businesses (especially traditional and small start-ups) to easily transform their operations and marketing strategies.”</p><p>What triggered the growth of the company was the COVID-19 Pandemic. As many of the businesses were not able to run as usual and they were forced to run online. Throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic in Malaysia for 2 years, the company has assisted more than 60 clients to reform and revamp their business, from offline to online, and reinforced online businesses to upscale.&nbsp;</p><p>The below graph shows the growth of the Ledgit over the years.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh5.googleusercontent.com/K6wMqQQwgyYeRSwpoyROYSMGmFwzHAPAeYQz5ASSMZZVhuuatU-MCECW-TQy-TCtEoM_v7jTK7UGNq0SLlIk7XwTOqveOatJeSLMAMXj8ZQNEo5NkEu2eAOJRFBvA6_eAjUDE6-lsEvudc8vIUAyTQ><p>“The reason for our consistency is that we always focus on delivering the right values and sustain the best strategies for our partners and clients.”</p><p>A firm belief of the Ledgit is to not stop with what they have, rather always focus on what can be provided better. It is because digital is always changing and evolving. And there still are a lot of businesses in the ASEAN region which require new technologies and strategies in the digital world.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, Ledgit does not only provide services to its clients, but also educates its clients so that they can be more aware of the Digital Era and bringing them forward in their hub towards the METAVERSE era. As for resources, Ledgit has always sought out the best and non-stop growing and learning to adapt to new strategies and engaging new collaborations with other alliances.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Products and Services-</h3><p>“With the power of technology, we have helped our client to reach a different set of audience that they never expected to have.”</p><p>Ledgit extended their market to places that they never expected to reach as they never expected their business to reach other countries, apart from upscaling their operations while reducing efforts and cost in building their operation team.</p><p>Ledgit specialized in several fields such as Digital Branding, Website and E-commerce, IT Solutions and Development and also Multimedia and Production, Blockchain & Dapps, Metaverse Ecosystem.</p><p>Other than the services stated above, Ledgit is always expanding the team to explore the future trend and acquire new skills in order to allow its partners and clients to achieve higher and bigger goals in the future; apart from integrating readily available resources and innovating new solutions.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Disrupting the Traditional Ways-</h3><p>Throughout history, technology has consistently changed the way workers across every industry do their jobs. From the industrial age to modern day, technology has improved working conditions. Its impact on the work environment has streamlined tedious and environmentally wasteful processes, expedited access to work while exponentially increasing productivity and made working from anywhere easier than ever.</p><p>“With marketing technology, blockchain as well as digital transformation, we believe that our efficiency and efficacy of work could be improved due to its convenience and mobility.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ivan Ku- Leading the Way-</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>CEO</h3><p>“An entrepreneur is an individual who creates and grows a business through their creative ideas.”</p><p>Ivan started his career with a degree in Finance from University of Hertfordshire (INTI International University) where he headed off to finance related industries and struggled in the working life of bankers and remisiers. Stresses and financial struggles made him wonder whether the rat race was suitable for him.&nbsp;</p><p>He then proceeded to join marketing companies as well as multi level marketing companies, engaging in sales and marketing, teambuilding and product knowledge. From here, Ivan’s journey started as he found out the many ways in life to be an entrepreneur. With the skill sets in finance, marketing and teambuilding, Ivan started the marketing company in the field of blockchain as it was a new industry and many opportunities were yet to be discovered.&nbsp;</p><p>“So, my team and I keep improving ourselves and learn more regarding the technology and the digital world.”</p><p>From then on, the team expanded and positioned themselves strategically by providing various tools for businesses to expand, while also venturing into many businesses along the way: Live Stream Platform, Metaverse SocialFi, Education & Academy and many more.</p><p>Throughout the journey, some of the professional achievements that Ivan has had are-</p><ul><li>Merit Honors Degree Holder in B.A. (Hons) in Finance & MBA from University of Wales Trinity.</li><li>Certified Blockchain Consultant by the Global Blockchain Research Institute of China,&nbsp;</li><li>Certified Distinctive Member of Blockchain Council,&nbsp;</li><li>Certified Crypto-Asset Consultant & Certified Blockchain Professional (CBCP),&nbsp;</li><li>Certified Blockchain Expert (CBE),&nbsp;</li><li>Successful Leader awarded by The Bizz Awards 2019,&nbsp;</li><li>Top 10 Best Inspiring CEOs of 2020 by Industry Era &&nbsp;</li><li>Recognized by APAC CIO Outlook 2018, 2019, 2020;&nbsp;</li><li>Nominated “Successful People in Malaysia 2021” by BritishPedia.</li><li>Featured in more than 100 local, International and Global News & Medias Platforms.</li><li>Ledgit achieved Top 101 Startup in Malaysia 2021 and Top 101 in Brand marketing, SEA 2022</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>A Team that Makes it all Happen-</h3><p>“First of all, I do not treat them as employees, I treat them as my team members.”</p><p>Traditional mindset such as “boss” does not work because it is actually restricting your team from growing and learning new skills. In Ledgit, they allow the team to explore and acquire new skills so that everyone is improving and growing together.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes them unique is that they focus on goals and results they agree on and set team goals based on outcomes and results, rather than just on the amount of work being done. A clear plan can then be set about how they are going to achieve these objectives, as a group, as well as each individual’s contribution. This provides them with clear direction and gives them something to aim for collectively.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ivan’s Advice to the Budding Entrepreneurs-</h3><p>“My advice to budding entrepreneurs is pretty simple and straightforward: Do what you love.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s little point in going into business simply to go into business. You have to have a passion for your product or service and to know it inside out. How many people have thought that running a PR agency is glamorous and easy money, only to find that the reality means long hours, chasing clients, getting knocked back, and struggling to establish themselves in a ruthlessly competitive market? Once you have your eye on a niche in the market, you’ll need to come up with a Unique Selling Point that nobody else has. Whatever you do, don’t fall into the trap of believing that you can apply a ‘scatter-gun’ approach to the market. You need to specialise.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLmmsMaiq2aapZ65pbXNoGSbqpGjsbR50Z6jopmSobJuv86lrK2hn6PA</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fledgit-building-brands-reliable-solutions.html&text=Ledgit-%20Building%20Brands%20With%20Reliable%20Solutions%20%7c%20Ivan%20Ku&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fledgit-building-brands-reliable-solutions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fledgit-building-brands-reliable-solutions.html&title=Ledgit-%20Building%20Brands%20With%20Reliable%20Solutions%20%7c%20Ivan%20Ku" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fledgit-building-brands-reliable-solutions.html&title=Ledgit-%20Building%20Brands%20With%20Reliable%20Solutions%20%7c%20Ivan%20Ku" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fledgit-building-brands-reliable-solutions.html&title=Ledgit-%20Building%20Brands%20With%20Reliable%20Solutions%20%7c%20Ivan%20Ku" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fledgit-building-brands-reliable-solutions.html&description=Ledgit-%20Building%20Brands%20With%20Reliable%20Solutions%20%7c%20Ivan%20Ku" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./wimbledon-rule-royal-children-prince-george-dont-have-to-follow.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Wimbledon rule that Prince George and other royal children don't have to follow">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./independent-type-foundry-advent-calendar.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Independent Type Foundry Advent Calendar  Chris Coyier">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
