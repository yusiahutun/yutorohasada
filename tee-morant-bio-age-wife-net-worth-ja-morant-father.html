The resemblance between the two was so uncanny that many started to question if they were related in any way — which they’re not!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, who is he? Keep reading this “Tee Morant Bio” to find out.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Tee Morant, Ja Morant Father</b></h3><p><span>Tee Morant is Ja Morant’s father who came to cheer his son like any other day for his game vs </span><i><span>Minnesota Timberwolves</span></i><span>. But little did he know that he would get famous after being seated next to Usher, wearing a matching black t-shirt and aviator sunglasses.</span></p><p><span>The duo was even shown on the Grizzlies’ “look-alike” cam during a timeout break and the crowd went crazy as the pair shook hands.</span></p><p><span>Naturally, the clip also blew up over the internet, and fans stated opinionating. “They’re literally twins,” a user wrote. While another tweeted, “Seems like they’re about to become best friends.”</span></p><h3><b>Tee Morant Age</b></h3><p><span>Tee Morant was no less than 40 years old when sat next to Usher in 2022.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, the “Yeah!” singer was 43 then.</span></p><h3><b>Tee Morant Job</b></h3><p><span>Tee is a barber. After narrowly missing playing in the NBA after his career at </span><i><span>Claflin University Panthers</span></i><span>, and finding out that his wife was pregnant with Ja, he left basketball to support the family.</span></p><p><span>However, Tee still has kept his passion for basketball alive, offering coaching classes through his eponymous “skill and agility training” program.</span></p><p><span>Talking about his basketball career, Tee played alongside Ray Alle at </span><i><span>Hillcrest High School, Dalzell, SC,</span></i><span> and went on to play college basketball at </span><i><span>Claflin University</span></i><span>. Later, he then went on to participate in free agency camps and play internationally until his professional aspirations were cut short because of a family burden.</span></p><p><span>But his dream now continues in his son Ja. He is actively involved in his son’s basketball development.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact: </b><span>Tee was spotted messing with Lebron James from the sidelines during his son’s game against the Lakers.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Tee Morant Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Tee Morant garnered a net worth of under $400 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, his son Ja Morant has earned over $27.5 million thought out his career.</span></p><h3><b>Tee Morant Wife</b></h3><p><span>Tee Morant’s wife Jamie Morant is also a former basketball player. She used to be a point guard in high school and a softball player in college.</span></p><p><span>The duo tied the knot in 2004 and was happily married as of 2022.</span></p><p><span>Talking a little more about Tee’s wife, Jamie was born on December 20, 1975. She hails from&nbsp; Appling, Georgia, and later went on to reside in&nbsp; Sumter, South Carolina.</span></p><p><span>According to Tee, he values Jamie, but more importantly — he “loves the $#@$ out” of her.</span></p><p><span>Besides Ja, Tee and Jamie also share another kid named Teniya Morant. She’s also a basketball athlete and played Girls varsity basketball at </span><i><span>Houston High School</span></i><span>. Unfortunately, their team was on a losing steak in Feb 2022.</span></p><p><span>Teniya was born on Feb 16, 2005, and stands tall at a height of 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm). But like her brother, she doesn’t let her small stature stop her from taking on anyone. “Some girls just play basketball for fun. I take basketball seriously,” she remarked.</span></p><h3><b>Tee Morant Height</b></h3><p><span>Tee stands tall at a height above 6 feet 3 inches (190 cm).</span></p><p><span>Whereas, his son Ja is exactly 6 feet 3 inches (190 cm). Though this might appear tall when compared to normal parole, he is on the smaller side in a league where the average height sits right around 6 feet 6 inches (198 cm).</span></p><h3><b>What Is Tee Morant Real Name?</b></h3><p><span>Tee’s real name is Ronnie T Morant.</span></p><p><span>His friends called him “Tee” because of his middle name.</span></p><h3><b>Tee Morant Family</b></h3><p><span>Tee comes from a family of five. Though his father is out of the scene, Tee’s mother, Saundra E. Dawson, often graced his socials.</span></p><p><span>On Saundra’s birthday (May 23, 2019), Tee took it to his FB to write, “LOVE YOU FOR BEING YOU AND SO MUCH OF ME IS YOU. ENJOY YOUR DAY MOTHER. HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOUR YOUNGEST LOVE YOU!”</span></p><p><span>As of 2022, Saundra resided in Sumter, South Carolina, and worked at </span><i><span>Prisma Health Tuomey Hospital</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Talking about Tee’s siblings, his baby Denise Dawson worked as an operations manager at </span><i><span>Michaels Stores</span></i><span> and lived in&nbsp; Sumter, South Carolina. While his brother Mar Cell Wiley was actively involved in the baseball industry.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Tee Morant Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Tee celebrates his birthday on November 15, making him of the Scorpio zodiac.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Tee Morant From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>He hails from Sumter, South Carolina.</span></p><p><span>But as of 2022, he lived in Memphis, Tennessee.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Did Tee Morant Play With Ray Allen?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Yes, Tee and Ray Allen go way back, all the way to high school.
