Most of the chairs and couches were thickly upholstered and were too soft to have caused the type and extent of injury Mr. Saget suffered. 'As mentioned earlier, most of the suite was carpeted. The headboard of the bed was lightly padded and set slightly out from the wall.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'These are listed here as possible mechanisms of injury, but nothing was located in the room that allows for a definitive conclusion.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Saget had driven himself back from a stand-up gig two hours away in Jacksonville before handing over the keys to his Chevrolet Impala and walking into the Ritz-Carlton at 2:13am.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The father-of-three was then seen on CCTV walking 'purposely across the lobby' before entering his room at 2:17am. When he failed to check out later that day security let themselves into his plush suite at 3:53pm and found Saget slumped dead in his bed with swelling and small bruises in the corner of his left eye.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The door to room 962 was latched from the inside and there was no sign of struggle, nothing was damaged and no trace of blood on his sheets or bedding, the report adds.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Unusually, the internal door to the adjoining room, 961, was found unlocked but staff established that nobody had been inside it while Saget was there. Saget had stopped briefly to pose for a selfie with valet worker Orlando Nunez, 21, as he walked inside the hotel, warning Nunez first that he was recovering from Covid.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cops later used the selfie to determine that Saget was uninjured when he went up to his room.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He had a mask on at that point so I had no idea who it was. I said it's fine to take it off because I've had Covid twice myself,' Nunez told DailyMail.com.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I recognized the voice but it was only when he took it off that I was like, oh man it's Bob Saget, it's so nice to meet you. 'I didn't see any injuries, he didn't seem hurt, he wasn't slurring his words – he was exactly as I remembered while watching him on the TV as a child. I was in awe.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nunez said the two men chatted warmly for several minutes about the pandemic, their families and their home state of California before they huddled for a photo on his cell phone. 'He said he'd just driven back from Jacksonville but he didn't seem tired at all, it was like he had just stepped off stage,' Nunez went on.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We talked about Covid and he made a joke about how there are so many strains now they are giving them sorority names. 'If anything I was very cautious about the picture as I wanted to be polite and respectful. But he said get in here, c'mon.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I've met a few celebrities who barely say a word but Bob was the most genuine, approachable guy. When I heard what had happened the next day I was devastated.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'People keep asking questions about what happened but I don't think there is a bigger pitcher that we are all missing. I just want him to rest in peace.'&nbsp;</p><h3>more videos</h3><a class=js-move-prev href=# id=ext-gen42><span></span></a><ul class=rotator-pages><li class=linkro-wocc><a href=# data-page=1><span
