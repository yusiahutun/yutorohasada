Dhruvsoft Services provides Salesforce.com Offshore outsourcing services from its offices in India to customers worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p>In an Interview with The Enterprise World, Sunil Khanna, CEO of the company describes the journey of Dhruvsoft Services, from a mere idea to a company providing best services to its customers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Tell us about Dhruvsoft Services.</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Dhruvsoft Services</a> started its journey in year 2010 with two founders at the helm. We are one of the earliest partners of Salesforce.com in India. There was no looking back since then – on the way we have also entered into partnerships with Google, Microsoft,Zoho and more recently with Oracle NetSuite.</p><p>With a humble start in 2010 – we have grown organically with a healthy growth rate and now have a strong team of young, dynamic ERP and CRM professionals. We pride ourselves in providing innovative solutions to our clients in ERP and CRM space. Our strength lies in the hard work and disciplined approach of our team to provide optimal solutions on time and in budget.</p><p>We have completed more than 250 successful ERP and CRM engagements till date and we are among the top players of Salesforce solution providers in India.</p><ul><li><strong>What were the initial challenges you faced?</strong></li></ul><p>Being a pure cloud services provider we had our share of challenges in the initial days. When we started in 2010 – that was the time when ‘Cloud’ was looked upon with lot of suspicion. All enterprise companies were very apprehensive of security of the cloud. In such time Dhruvsoft Services focused on educating the customers and building a market for Salesforce.com and other cloud applications.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Timeline-of-Partnerships-Dhruvsoft-1024x339.jpg><ul><li><strong>Which was that point that triggered the growth of the Dhruvsoft Services?</strong></li></ul><p>Around 2014-15 was this inflection point when we started doing the product development for Salesforce.com ISV partners. From a mere implementation and consulting company – we have now become a product development company. We started developing <a href=#>products of Salesforce platform</a> for ISV vendors and have successfully help development and launch of over ten applications. Around the same time we also became partners of Zoho which enabled us to cater to CRM needs of SMB organizations.</p><ul><li><strong>What is the reason behind your company’s long-standing success?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Our people – our consultants – are the reason for our success. Even when we were very small we never compromised on quality of resources we hire. With the poor quality of resources who were available laterally – we have focussed on hiring the fresh and bright talent from colleges and trained them. We have rigorous processes to train and coach our people and make a fresher into a bright consultant. The experience based learning makes them productive very fast. Our culture of persistence and hard work with strong processes ensure the long standing success of Dhruvsoft Services.</p><p><strong>The Products/Services-</strong></p><ul><li><strong>What are the products/services Dhruvsoft Services focuses on? How are your services different from those in the market?</strong></li></ul><p>We provide ERP and CRM consulting services – and Salesforce.com CRM is one of our dominant practice. Our offerings include ERP/CRM strategy & process consulting, ERP/CRM implementation and customization, System integration, training, migrations, and ongoing support. The ERP / CRM products we focus on includeSalesforce.com, Zoho and Oracle NetSuite. We are consulting partners of these companies.</p><p>In addition to consulting services we provide Product Development Services on Salesforce.com, Zoho and Oracle NetSuite – these are targeted towards Independent Software Vendors (ISVs).</p><p>In addition to this we have two of our own products. One is SIVIO a solution for Admission Management for Universities and Education Institutes. Another is Propelty – which is a CRM solution for Property brokers and agents. SIVIO is a product developed on Salesforce.com platform.</p><p>We have a long-term perspective for Dhruvsoft Services. We remained bootstrapped over the years – to ensure that we have independence of decision making and focus of customer success. This might have curtailed our growth to some extent – but we believe in slow but steady growth. We believe in growing with clients – some of our clients are with us for years. We are continuously working to enhance capability and building accelerator solutions to bring more value to the table.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Timeline-of-Grwoth-Dhruvsoft.jpg><p>Companies of all sizes from all over the world have taken advantage of services delivered by Dhruvsoft Services. We believe that new business and repeat business is achieved through a total commitment in providing the best value for our clients. In any assignment we become a trusted partner of client that truly understands their business process and technology needs.</p><ul><li><strong>How do you decide to take Dhruvsoft Services a step further in terms of your products/services?</strong></li></ul><p>The penetration of CRM solutions is very limited in India. Most of the companies still use primitive on paper, excel based methods for Sales, Marketing and Service. Even those who use technology – have silos and ineffective solutions. Some of them still use the legacy solutions of client server era. We see this market to grow and mature in the next five years as more and more businesses will be leveraging technology to become competitive.</p><p>We are building more industry specific frameworks – we have solutions for Pharmaceutical/API business, Real estate / property Business, Software / IT companies, and Start-ups and VCs. We will be building more industry specific accelerator solutions.</p><p>We believe that technologies like AI and ML will surely add an extra plus to the CRM segment. We are working on developing new AI/ML offerings for our customers.</p><ul><li><strong>Is there any new addition to the list of products/services? Anything exciting you would like to share?</strong></li></ul><p>We have added Salesforce CPQ, Salesforce Field Services, Pardot and Marketing Cloud implementation capability to our services and are now doing multiple engagements for same. We will be launching two new products in 2021 on Salesforce platform. We will also be launching our services for Salesforce.com Commerce Cloud and Industry Clouds in 2021.</p><p><strong>Leadership-</strong></p><ul><li><strong>What do you think are the responsibilities of an entrepreneur?</strong></li></ul><p>As an entrepreneur we are responsible for our stakeholders – customers, employees and investors. We are responsible for creating value for our customers – giving them value for the money that they spend on our product or service. We are responsible for creating value for our employees – ensuring them success in their career. And of course our investors and shareholders – we have to generate value for them to give them the returns on their investment.</p><p>As an entrepreneur we have to balance the needs of all these stakeholders and ensure that this file balance is maintained.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you please brief us about your professional experience?</strong></li></ul><p>I come with over two-and-a-half decades of experience in the IT industry. I am an Electrical Engineer, MBA and CFA. I started my career working as a lab assistant in an engineering college. Then joined a leading private steel maker – where for over four years worked in various functions of large organization where we were setting up of a Greenfield plant.</p><p>I left the organization to complete my MBA. After that joined one of the leading IT services firm and started my journey in software industry. I worked as a Consultant with some of the leading organizations across in India, UK and USA. I took the flight to my entrepreneurial journey in 2004. After laying the foundations of two successful ventures, a medical equipment company and a recruitment process outsourcing business, I founded Dhruvsoft Services with a vision to provide cloud based products and services.</p><ul><li><strong>What are the key achievements of your entrepreneurial journey?</strong></li></ul><p>Having founded three successful ventures gives me great satisfaction. In the process we have given employment to over 400 persons and contributed to the Make in India initiative. In a previous venture we have developed medical equipment in India while reducing the dependency on costly imports. At Dhruvsoft Services also we are developing world class products for clients from all over the world.</p><ul><li><strong>How do you look after your employees? What makes your team unique?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of our employees will vouch for this – Dhruvsoft Services is a great learning ground. Learning and constantly reskilling is a way of life here. Having worked at a leading IT company before I can confidently say that – what our consultants learn and experience in two years, it will take four to five years in a large IT services companies for them to learn. We look after employees by giving them a highly learning and creative environment.</p><ul><li><strong>Is there any special experience with your clients you would like to highlight?</strong></li></ul><p>For me all client engagements and experiences are very special. My most special experiences were while working with several Non Profit organizations and implementing Salesforce form them. As a part of our commitment to community we have worked with several not profits. Some of them are doing excellent work for the community and we are proud to be associated with them.</p><p><strong>Personal Questions-</strong></p><ul><li><strong>One person who you admire the most?</strong></li></ul><p>I admire the contemporary businessmen – Marc Benioff – Founder of Salesforce.com. He has created a great company from scratch and has pioneered the concepts like 1:1:1 program.</p><p>In additional to that I admire JRD Tata for his business acumen and vision.</p><ul><li><strong>Whose business story do you find the most inspiring?</strong></li></ul><p>The story of Tata group in India is very inspiring and also their values had a deep impact on me from my initial years.</p><p>One must forever strive for excellence, or even perfection, in any task, however small, and never be satisfied with the second best.</p>JRD Tata<ul><li><strong>Constant vigilance- a need or a strategy? Please share your views.</strong></li></ul><p>I would say that constant vigilance is a need for businesses. As business grow – we have to maintain some checks and balances. We have to maintain constant vigilance to ensure that everything is under control.</p><ul><li><strong>It’s a rat-race out there. How do you cope with that?</strong></li></ul><p>Of course it is a competitive world – not only for us but for everyone. We have to maintain our balance and keep efforts to achieve what we are set out to. Our values are the guiding lamps for us and help us cope with uncertainties and competition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLGpvtSvqqiepGLApr7Vopqeq12Xwqq4w2abnqicpMZuv9Spp6iqpA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdhruvsoft-services-build-deploy-support.html&text=Dhruvsoft%20Services%20%7c%20Sunil%20Khanna&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdhruvsoft-services-build-deploy-support.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdhruvsoft-services-build-deploy-support.html&title=Dhruvsoft%20Services%20%7c%20Sunil%20Khanna" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdhruvsoft-services-build-deploy-support.html&title=Dhruvsoft%20Services%20%7c%20Sunil%20Khanna" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdhruvsoft-services-build-deploy-support.html&title=Dhruvsoft%20Services%20%7c%20Sunil%20Khanna" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdhruvsoft-services-build-deploy-support.html&description=Dhruvsoft%20Services%20%7c%20Sunil%20Khanna" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./406773-mario-andres-moreno-5-quick-facts-barbara-bermudos-husband-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mario Andres Moreno: 5 quick facts about Brbara Bermudo's husband">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./413405-50-coolest-senior-year-captions-share-instagram-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="50+ coolest senior year captions to share on your Instagram">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
