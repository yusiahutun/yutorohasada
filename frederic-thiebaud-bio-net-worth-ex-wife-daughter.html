They have been together for more than a decade. Learn about his current job, his age, and his net worth in this article below.</p><p>We attempt to cover it all here.</p><h3><strong>Meet Frederic Thiebaud, Shania Twain Husband</strong></h3><p>When Shania Twain was feeling like she would never recover from the shallow pain the singer felt while going through the process of ending her 14-year-long marriage, Frédéric Thiébaud shined the beam of hope. It was Frédéric who approached the singer with the news that his wife and Shania’s husband were having an affair.</p><p>After Frederic discovered it, he confronted his wife and Mutt Lange to come clean about it to Shania. Fred told in Oprah’s show, “I said, ‘Guys, now you have to tell her. This is ridiculous. You just owe her that”. Once they refused, Fred who later became Shania’s second husband revealed it to Shania.</p><p>The singer of Any Man of Mine said that Frédéric was the one who truly notified her about Marie-relationship Anne with Lange during an appearance on Ellen DeGeneres in 2011. Twain recalled, “I didn’t believe him and I thought for sure he was making it up. I was obviously just in denial on my part”.</p><p>Shania told Oprah, “Fred and Mutt were good friends, and Marie-Anne and I were good friends”. Shania confronted Marie-Anne calling her over to clarify what was going on. But, she refused to reveal that anything happened between her and Mutt.</p><p>But as Frederic and Shania were going through this process together, they ended up falling in love with each other. “I got to observe Fred going through the same thing I was and I admired how he handled it,” Twain&nbsp;<a class=external-link title="(opens new window)" href=# rel=noopener aria-describedby=external-disclaimer>said</a>. “That is where I fell in love with him because he was so exemplary in every way.”</p><p>“The person to comfort me was Fred because he’s been through the exact same thing,” Shania told Oprah. “Fred was safe. So it was really a beautiful and perfect friendship.”</p><p>The following August, engagement rumors started to swirl after Twain and Thiébaud were spotted wearing rings&nbsp;in Canada&nbsp;while vacationing at the singer’s lakefront cottage with her son,&nbsp;Eja, and Thiébaud’s daughter,&nbsp;Johanna.</p><p>“They are not engaged and they are not married,” Shania Twain’s rep told PEOPLE at the time. <span>A few days later, Shania shared a travel video on </span>her website<span> that documented a skydiving trip in Florida, a camel-riding adventure in Egypt, and a bike ride through a London park with Thiébaud, who the Grammy winner called “a dear friend and true gentleman”.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“Having gone through the suffering of his family splitting apart at the same time and under the same extreme circumstances, he understands me better than anyone,” Shania wrote&nbsp;in a letter to fans.</p><p>In 2011, on New Year’s Day, Shania married Frédéric in Rincon, Puerto Rico. Frédéric&nbsp;and Shania are very much in love with each other. They can also be seen making public appearances at several events together.</p><h3><strong>Frederic Thiebaud Ex-Wife</strong></h3><p>Frederic Thiebaud was previously married to his now ex-wife <a href=#>Marie-Anne Thiebaud</a>. They shared a daughter from their marriage named Johanna Thiebaud. When the affair surfaced for the first time, Marie-Anne was working at Lange’s home According to Belfast Telegraph, the singer had hired Marie to work for her in Switzerland to look after their 46-room chateau.</p><p>To this day, fans questions couldn’t understand why Marie-Anne worked for Shania while her husband Frederic was a successful businessman.</p><h3><strong>Frederic Thiebaud Daughter</strong></h3><p>Frederic Thiebaud has one daughter named Johanna Thiebaud. She was born in 2000 and is a year older than Mutt and Shania’s son Eja.
