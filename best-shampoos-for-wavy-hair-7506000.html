It’s not quite curly, yet it’s not quite straight, which places it in a nebulous state, landing somewhere in between the two. Since it’s not one or the other, that can make it difficult to find the right products and tools like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair masks</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hair dryers</a>, and, most infuriatingly, shampoos.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And though the versatility of wavy hair gives you free range to master practically any style, trying to do so is an exercise in futility if you’re not using the right formula that caters to your specific texture, length, and hair density. Sudsing up with something a little too heavy can cause finer wavy hair to look oily fast, but using something too lightweight may not give you that satisfying squeaky clean feeling. Fortunately, we found experts who specialize in understanding what it takes to tame waves and smooth tresses while enhancing your natural curl pattern.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-briogeo-curl-charisma-rice-amino--avocado-leave-in-defining-crme></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Briogeo Curl Charisma</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Avocado Leave-in Defining Cr&amp;egrave;me" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oQcaWImq4cAN0HcCKnMjua3BKEc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/briogeo-curl-charisma-7e5a15e9825c4cb7a90a1b37b5be3a2b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Briogeo</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The creamy, lightweight shampoo contains natural, vitamin-rich ingredients that hold your waves in place and prevents frizz.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>A little goes a long way — using too much could leave you with weighted strands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your waves could take a vitality shot, it would include the nourishing ingredients found in this Briogeo shampoo.

Fast-forward a couple of centuries and this ingredient is taking over our social media algorithms today — and for good reason, too.&nbsp;Take Pantene’s sulfate and silicone-free formula, which is full of antioxidant-rich rice water and rice bran, to give you the strongest hair imaginable. Pantene also included pro-vitamin B5 which has restorative, smoothing properties that can revive hair that can shield hair against environmental factors like pollution and revive heat or color-damaged strands.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=1></span>&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After testing the product for several weeks, we can vouch that the formula does everything it promises: Our strands felt softer after one wash, and over time we were thrilled to see our hair grow out with no split ends or breakage. Paired alongside the conditioner, this duo provides enough moisture to satiate dry, wavy hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>9.5 oz<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Rice water, pro-vitamin B-5, sodium citrate<strong> | Scented: </strong>Yes<strong> | Sulfate-Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thick-wavy-hair-kevin-murphy-hydrate-me-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Thick, Wavy Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kevin Murphy Hydrate-Me Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kevin.Murphy Hydrate-Me" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FSfw_P47hOS0IS66_SeH8rUNfzk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kevin.MurphyHydrate-Me.Wash-31f9be1cb412458995a234ad8d57fa91.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kevin Murphy</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>We immediately noticed less frizz in our hair after the first wash.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Washing with it too often could cause finer hair to become oily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don't get us wrong, we love hearing hairdressers praise our thick, wavy hair, but finding a formula that gives this hair type the same amount of shine and definition we see during salon visits is a true pain. However, the Kevin Murphy Hydrate-Me shampoo gives our stylist a run for her money as each wash with its nourishing formula gave us frizz-free, luscious locks that could rival any pricey blowout.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The brand crafted a thoughtful formula full of rehydrating humectants, notably shea butter, and lightweight plant-based oils that defined our dense waves, tamed static, and made our hair air dry like a dream. (Keep in mind that sometimes oils weigh down finer strands, so we suggest using the shampoo two or three times a week to start.) Additionally, it typically requires a lot of product to work up a lather rich enough to cover our thick strands, but this gentle formula foamed up quickly and gave our scalps a quick and efficient scrub down. Perhaps the best part is how the vitamin-infused formula restored shine and vibrancy to our dull hair, making it a great choice for anyone with serious damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 8.4 oz <strong>| Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamins A and C, shea butter, evening primrose oil<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;| Scented: </strong>Yes <strong>| Sulfate-Free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-dove-amplified-textures-hydrating-cleanse-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dove Amplified Textures Hydrating Cleanse Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dove Amplified Textures Hydrating Cleanse Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UDaDbg8oxzInQ6Kxhw7VCkuHfhY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dove-amplified-textures-hydrating-cleanse-shampoo-179dc3fee0c24508a4176305104755aa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The shampoo uses plant-based ingredients like aloe vera to gently cleanse and hydrate dry scalps without irritation.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It takes a while to work up a lather.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dove’s formulas have often impressed us with how they seemingly work across all hair textures, so it came as no surprise when celebrity hairstylist and founder of Deeper Than Hair, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Annagjid Kee Taylor</a> recommended this product. Specifically formulated for wavy hair, Taylor says not only is it great for removing product build-up, but it will also “leave your hair super hydrated.” This isn’t an easy feat, considering some cleansing shampoos use sulfates that can dry out your hair, but thanks to its inclusion of thanks to shea butter and coconut oil, the results are quite the opposite.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another way it achieves healthy-looking hair is the inclusion of aloe, a plant-based ingredient that boasts naturally antibacterial properties, to simultaneously moisturize and slough away grime.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=2></span> It's important to note that it’ll take longer to work up a lather than with other shampoos, but you can be certain this doesn’t impact its efficacy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>32.3 oz<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Aloe, shea butter, coconut oil <strong>| Scented: </strong>Yes<strong> | Sulfate-Free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-oribe-shampoo-for-moisture--control></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Oribe Shampoo for Moisture & Control</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Oribe Shampoo for Moisture &amp;amp; Control" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4EPz2BFY0UX8el93W7hUO9CrXWI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/xoribe-moisture--control-shampoo-ca559fc9345648a0957aa41f7327784d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This sulfate-free shampoo uses ingredients rich in antioxidants and amino acids to leave wavy hair shiny and strengthened.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Low porosity hair could look a little greasy after using the shampoo too often.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s not uncommon for an Oribe product to catch our eye and it’s not just because it bottles its products in enticing, gem-colored packaging. The high-end hair brand uses its signature complex yet again — a blend of watermelon, lychee, and edelweiss flower — and hydrating ingredients, like glycerin, amber seed extract, and sunflower seed extract, to leave our hair so smooth we could skip a stone across it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What makes this particular formula so fantastic for wavy hair is that it makes type 2 curls a top priority by including an amino acid complex that will help better define them into an S-shaped pattern. Your tresses will take to these ingredients easily because they’re similar to the proteins found naturally in your hair, meaning that over time, you should see stronger hair and fewer ragged ends.

For this shampoo, the brand blended three ultra-hydrating oils — babassu oil, patauá oil, and cupuaçu butter —&nbsp; that are chock full of lipids and antioxidants to give your hair a glossy sheen.

The ingredient lineup includes all the conditioning emollients we seek out when trying to quench parched strands: Coconut oil, grape seed oil, and glycerin. We know — it sounds like a lot to slather across strands, but without silicones, parabens, or sulfates added into the mix, you won’t feel like the formula sits heavy on your hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;In addition to leaving out these potential irritants, the brand also says that each one of its formulas is dermatologist-tested, making it a certifiable safe choice for sensitive scalps.

But luckily, less drastic measures are required when we can preserve our color-treated hair with gentle shampoos. One of our favorites is this pick from Kérastase because it helps maintain the integrity of our waves with a sulfate-free, lightweight formula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It contains several ingredients that are worthy competitors on the skin and hair care battleground: Lactic, tartaric, and salicylic acid. They are some of the best natural exfoliants out there to gently break up any dirt and oil hanging out in your hair. As a result, you’ll find yourself dealing with fewer flakes and less oil. Finally, by adding amino acids into the formula, the shampoo seals cuticles shut to boost shine. As a bonus, if your scalp tends to be itchy, centella asiatica will reduce irritation. And because it leaves out heavy oils, we think this could be a great choice for those with fine hair — just keep in mind you may need to follow it up with a hydrating conditioner to see the most hydrated results.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;<strong>Size: </strong>8.5 oz <strong>| Key Ingredients: </strong>Amino acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid <strong>| Scented: </strong>Yes<strong> | Sulfate-Free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-coarse-hair-bumble--bumble-curl-moisturizing-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Coarse Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bumble & bumble Curl Moisturizing Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bumble &amp;amp; Bumble Curl Moisturizing Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/n0NNE79X5DVSVb77BBAA527TPls=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bumble--bumble-curl-moisturizing-shampoo-12e90191f1404f0b9b231388c6118ef7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Packed full of vitamin-rich ingredients and plant-based butters, this formula is gentle on brittle hair but still loads it up with plenty of moisture to revive and strengthen strands.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It leaves a bit of residue on your scalp if you don’t take time to wash it out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Consider this shampoo a magician that will whip unruly hair into shape as vitamin-rich and hydrating ingredients like avocado, coconut, and jojoba seed oil take serious grievance against every brittle strand that they encounter. Cocoa and shea butters eliminate frizz and soften strands, so you can finally brush through your hair without getting snagged on every bristle. You’ll also notice that your curl pattern stays intact throughout the day, since all of these ingredients contain vitamins that strengthen strands.&nbsp;Because coarse hair tends to be quite vulnerable, we appreciate that the formula is devoid of moisture-zapping sulfates that could cause breakage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One more suggestion: Take time to thoroughly wash all of the product out of your air as the oils can leave behind a little residue.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>8.5 oz <strong>| Key Ingredients: </strong>Avocado oil, coconut oil, jojoba seed oil, shea butter, cocoa butter <strong>| Scented: </strong>Yes<strong> | Sulfate-Free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curl-enhancing-sheamoisture-coconut--hibiscus-curl--shine-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Curl Enhancing</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SheaMoisture Coconut &amp;amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp;amp; Shine Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mIu5Wh9KjOk788V7plCDZzOdbtk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SheaMoisture-Coconut--Hibiscus-Curl--Shine-Shampoo-30f83870aee74055bed0419f19325fdf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The sulfate-free formula treats curls to a delicate wash that leaves them more defined, voluminous, and soft.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It contains oils that could weigh down fine hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If there’s one thing curls love, it’s moisture and this formula is like an IV drip for our waves and ringlets. Instead of harnessing sulfates to cleanse the hair, this shampoo uses neem oil, which not only smooths frizz with its fatty acids, but is also full of vitamin E and other antibacterial and antimicrobial properties to gently slough away dead skin and dandruff without irritating the scalp.&nbsp; Dense hair will drink up this formula and help those curls become more defined, but the oils may weigh down very fine hair if this shampoo is used too often.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 13 oz <strong>| Key Ingredients: </strong>Coconut oil, silk protein, neem oil <strong>| Scented: </strong>Yes<strong> | Sulfate-Free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-strengthening-ranavat-regenerative-veda-bond-complex-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Strengthening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ranavat Regenerative Veda⁴ Bond Complex Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ranavat Regenerative Veda&amp;acirc;&amp;acute; Bond Complex Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7X0NXinj9jFE_OLLhpA7MzUssA8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ranavat-regenerative-veda-bond-complex-shampoo-fdc5d0f615b2458581a8aa2f18bfd037.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ranavat</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The brand uses its signature plant-powered complex to increase elasticity and prevent breakage.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t have the thick consistency of traditional shampoo.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Consider this shampoo a strength training class for your hair. It features a plant-powered super complex containing pink lotus, hibiscus, alma, and ashwagandha, to rebuild damaged hair from the inside out. This formula credits Ayurvedic philosophies and South Asian beauty practices for its innovative formula. Amla, for example, is an ingredient found on South Asian Indian Gooseberry trees that can stimulate hair growth, making them softer and shinier.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=10></span>&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, it smells like the inside of a 5-star hotel lobby: Intoxicating, discreet, and somehow nostalgic. What’s even better is that the enticing fragrance is the byproduct of the shampoo’s natural ingredients and not a synthetic additive.&nbsp; Coined a “champagne lather” by the brand, the sulfate-free formula has a serum-like consistency that melts into your strands as you work it through your hair, rather than giving you a sudsy foam. Though we found this experience delightful, this may take a little getting used to for anyone who loves a rich foam.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 8 oz <strong>| Key Ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid, pink lotus, hibiscus, Ashwagandha, alma<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;| Scented: </strong>Yes<strong> | Sulfate-Free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> “Wavy hair tends to dry out faster,” says Taylor, so finding a shampoo that is jam-packed with hydrating oils is key. However, both Taylor and Dueñas agree that creamy or rich shampoos should be avoided or used in small amounts to prevent hair from getting weighed down. Instead, Dueñas recommends looking for products that contain coconut oil, argan oil, and jojoba oil, while Taylor says formulas that contain glycerin and plant-based butters, such as shea and cocoa, along with essential oils, like lavender and almond, also work together beautifully to maintain frizz.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Hair Texture: </strong>Hair texture plays an important role in what formula will work best for you, but it’s equally important to assess what your strands need, says Taylor. For example, if you have fine and thin hair that’s also dry, Taylor recommends looking for a caffeine-infused shampoo with moisturizing ingredients, as it helps with volume in the hair, she says.&nbsp;Another simple tip for anyone with fine hair to follow, according to Dueñas, is to look for formulas with oils that are listed further down the ingredient list, which means they’re being used at a lower concentration, and therefore less likely to leave hair feeling heavy. However, if you have thick or coarse hair, don’t be shy about using shampoos that list oils as the first or second ingredient. Humectants like glycerine, or&nbsp;hydrating butters also work wonders on coarse textures.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sulfate-Free Formulas: </strong>Wavy hair thrives with hydration, so one surefire way to keep it healthy and happy is to opt for a sulfate-free formula—especially in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shampoos for damaged hair</a>. “These shampoos prevent the removal of moisture while still cleaning the hair,” says hairstylist and Digital Artistic Educator for Schwarzkopf <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Brendnetta Ashley</a>.&nbsp;Instead, you keep an eye out for plant-derived surfactants, like those found in palm fruits, or formulas that contain ingredients with natural antibacterial properties, such as aloe and witch hazel, that gently dissolve oils and dirt.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you wash wavy hair?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our experts agree that washing wavy hair more than two times a week could strip it of the natural oils it needs to stay healthy, and washing too often can “cause dry brittle hair that can lead to breakage,” says Ashley.&nbsp;Instead, focus on how much time you spend in the shower during wash days. Ashley says you should double rinse with your shampoo, starting with a quick wash before going in a second time and scrubbing longer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Taylor always recommends using a super moisturizing conditioner after every wash to help detangle the hair. However, if&nbsp;your hair is particularly dry and frizzy, try “mixing a small amount of conditioner in with your shampoo to hydrate and cleanse at the same time,” says Dueñas.&nbsp;And while your wavy hair certainly needs hydration, relying on too many oils too often can lead to product buildup, which is where a really great clarifying shampoo comes in handy. “I would recommend using a detox shampoo first and following it up with a moisturizing shampoo,” says Ashley.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What makes wavy hair less frizzy?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Taylor recommends washing wavy hair in cold water to prevent frizz. “Lower temperatures protect your hair and prevent overdrying and flyaways,” she says, adding that you can finish off your routine by brushing through your hair with a wide-toothed comb. This avoids any tugging or snagging as you gently detangle hair. Using microfiber <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair towels</a> made from finer fibers will also cause less friction and pulling on your hair, says Taylor, which can result in frizz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After washing your hair, try to avoid touching it before it’s fully dry, says Ashley. “If the hair is not dry and you're constantly touching or tousling your hair, you will create frizz.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you dry wavy hair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The easiest way to style wavy hair is by letting it air dry — albeit the technique requires a little more patience. “The key to letting it air dry is using a leave-in conditioner to help tame flyaways and define your hair’s natural texture,” says Taylor. To enhance your waves, Dueñas says that you can scrunch your wet hair with a t-shirt or microfiber towel or braid your strands into large sections while you wait for them to dry.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On days that require heat, a diffuser is your best bet at seeing those defined, bouncy waves come to life. Ashley recommends starting with your dryer on medium heat and airflow as you work it around your head, being careful not to “fully insert it into the hair as the outer cast of the hair needs to dry first.” For more volume, “flip your head upside down and place the diffuser into your hair,” she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t forget to finish with a cool shot, says Taylor. “This locks the look together and helps the style last longer.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a> is a writer covering fashion and beauty trends.
