As a child, he was scared of thunderstorms but, as he grew up a little, he became fascinated by them. It was very easy to pick presents for him as he would only want a barometer or a weather alert radio. He grew up to become a weather forecaster caught up in a lot of scandals. He has only been married once.</p><h2>John Bolaris's Early Life</h2><p><strong>John Bolaris</strong> was born on June 27, 1957, America and studied at Connetquot High School in New York. When John was a child, he used to drag his little sister, <strong>Paula Bolaris</strong>, to the roof of their childhood home on Long Island to watch the sky.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/12/abc-news.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><strong>John Bolaris</strong> <strong>Source: ABC News</strong><p>His parents always knew what to get him for his birthday, a barometer or a weather alert radio. He would draw weather maps-not for school, just on his own. When everyone was running home from a storm, he would be on his bike heading towards it.</p><h2>John Bolaris's Career</h2><p>John Bolaris is an American meteorologist who worked as the Chief Meteorologist for NBC, CBS, and FOX for 18 consecutive years. He has won four Mid-Atlantic Emmy Awards-three for Best Weathercaster and one for Best Entertainment Host for 'Time Out', a television show he co-hosted for five years on WCAU in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p><p>Bolaris started his TV career in 1982 at Metro Weather Service where he worked as a syndicated meteorologist until 1987, when he joined News 12 Long Island. At age of 29, and with just a single week of television experience under his belt, Bolaris was named the weekend weather anchor for WCBS in New York and stayed there until 1990.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/12/alchetron.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><strong>John Bolaris Photoshoot&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Source: Alchetron</strong><p>After a few months, he talked himself onto a C-130 bound for Hurricane Hugo. His live dispatches from the storm's eye brought him on the national news with Dan Rather.</p><p>On November 1, 2007, he moved back to Philadelphia to become the chief weatherman for WTXF-TV, for their 5 p.m and 10 p.m. newscasts.&nbsp;</p><p>He founded his own weather wire service, weathersavior.com, in 2014 which lasted about a year before he pulled the plug. In 2015, he began hosting a weekly local radio show, CenterStage with John Bolaris.</p><p></p><p>In 2016, Bolaris made it known that he was following his passion for real estate as well and earned his licensed in Pennsylvania and New York. He founded Black Label Luxury Real Estate. Then he announced that he was listing (for $58 million) the 14-acre Long Island estate on which<strong> F. Scott Fitzgerald</strong> wrote The Great Gatsby.</p><h2>John Bolaris Net Worth</h2><p>There is a lot of information about his professional life but little to no information related to John Bolaris net worth and other financial facts are available. Nowadays, he spends most of his time with his real estate business and it is said that his salary is much impressive than that from television networks. The figure of his net worth is estimated to be close to a&nbsp;million dollars.</p><p>The real estate industry was like a clear sky to the weatherman. Therefore, he joined the brokerage company named The Condo Shop. When he was at the television networks, John Bolaris annual salary was $0.6 million dollars. His current remuneration has not yet been disclosed to the public and media.</p><h2>John Bolaris Personal Life</h2><p>John married his only wife, New York model <strong>Pamela Duswalt</strong> in 1988, five days after his mother died of a heart attack. Pamela was the former girlfriend of Buffalo Bills quarterback <strong>Jim Kelly</strong>. Bolaris told <strong>Philly Mag</strong> in 1996 that Pamela insisted the wedding go forward despite his grief.</p><p>On the day of his WCAU-TV television debut, his wife announced that she was leaving him and staying in New York.</p><p>In Philadelphia, Bolaris's life became a real-life soap opera on and off the set. Bolaris kept on dating: aspiring actresses, beauty queens, co-workers, interns, Center City scenesters, Jersey Shore hookups, and a few notable names.</p><p>The list of conquests included Merion's, <strong>Julie Cohen. </strong>He bought her a ring and the station wanted to film his proposal, but she turned him down. He then dated singer <strong>Lauren Hart</strong>&nbsp;and even got engaged to her but they called it off. His other conquests were Flyers goalie <strong>Bernie Parent</strong>'s daughter <strong>Kim Parent</strong>; fashion designer <strong>Nicole Miller</strong>; Miami weather babe <strong>Maria Genero</strong> and co-worker <strong>Jane Robelot</strong>.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/12/phillychitchat.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><strong>John Bolaris with his then-fiance Erica Smitheman</strong> <strong>Source: Phillychitchat</strong><p>In 2011, he was in a relationship with former Playboy Playmate <strong>Erica Smitheman</strong> and they got engaged on the Howard Stern show in 2012 when he was 55 and she was 33. A few months later, she commandeered his phone while he was asleep and tweeted sexy pictures of herself to all his Twitter followers.</p><p>John is also a father of one child. Former WCAU co-worker and current Philly media maven <strong>Tiffany McElroy</strong> became the mother of Bolaris's only child, <strong>Reina Sofia</strong>, in 2004.</p><p>Also, Read <a href=#>Jerry Taft</a>, <a href=#>Rick Reichmuth</a>, <a href=#>Reynolds Wolf</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK571qKiomeapLWvecGoo5qqmag%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjohn-bolaris.html&text=John%20Bolaris%20Biography&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-bolaris.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-bolaris.html&title=John%20Bolaris%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjohn-bolaris.html&title=John%20Bolaris%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-bolaris.html&title=John%20Bolaris%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-bolaris.html&description=John%20Bolaris%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./meaning-of-brat-by-green-day.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meaning of Brat by Green Day">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./article-40a2afc0-8d2b-11ed-9645-af65c5325d2d-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dr. Thomas Ford Leggett Jr. | Obituaries">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
