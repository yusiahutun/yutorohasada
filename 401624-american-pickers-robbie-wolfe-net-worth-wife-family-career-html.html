Together with his brother Mike, they moved around collecting old bicycles. They would then refurbish them for money.</p><p class=align-left>With time, they discovered that they could turn their passion into a career. Currently, they are professionals in the antique collection field in the US. They have shops where they store, restore, and sell refurbished automobiles and other collectables.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4ddc757f368bc85a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ian Alexander Sr.: Everything you need to know about Regina King's husband</span></p></a><h3>Career highlights</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7bf4c477c2dbab8e.jpg><p class=align-left>What does Robbie Wolfe do for a living? He is a Jack-of-all-trades. First, Robbie is a renowned antique collector. He has been travelling across America and other parts of the world collecting old automobiles and other <a href=#>valuable collectables</a>.</p><p class=align-left>He has been in the business for over three and a half decades now. Normally, he buys and refurbishes various collectables and then sells them. Some of the <a id=https://www.rjwolfepicker.com/buy-sell href=# rel="nofollow noopener">particular items</a> you are likely to find in his shops include bicycles, oils cans, trucks/cars, Neons, and license plate covers.</p><p class=align-left>Secondly, Wolfe is a reality television star.
