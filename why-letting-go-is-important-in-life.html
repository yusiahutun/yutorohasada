It’s the right time to summarize past experiences, learn from them, and start fresh. As every year has some good or bad memories, this year too had some heart-warming and heart-breaking experiences. Few people have lost the close one, and few people have found love once. Few people have gained health and wealth, and few have lost it. But one thing is common among all: we all had the courage to survive, even when it was difficult. Sometimes the act of living is also an act of courage. Life is not easy to live, and if it’s easy, it’s not life, which is worth living.</p><p>We all want to learn in life, but we all find it hard to face challenges. But have you ever thought that it is possible to get fruits from trees if they do not survive weather changes? What I am trying to say is that if you had a hard time or a bad time last year, it’s because it was meant to be. You are on the path to where you are destined to go. We can choose the destination and path, but not the hurdles in the path. To face them, we have to keep working on us and preparing us as never before. This is how we will all live a worthy life.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>How does Socializing improve your Quality of Life?</a></strong></p><p>But before this year ends, let’s learn to let go of bad memories. Letting go does not mean forgetting the experience; it is just about reducing the impact of emotions attached to that memory. No memory is worth forgetting, because if we forget it, we create more chances of repeating it. So let’s understand in detail how we can neutralize or reduce the effect of such memories and learn to let go.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>What is letting go?</h4><p>In simple terms, letting go is about stopping to think about or getting affected by a previous or past bad experience in life. As those thoughts and experiences do not serve us any benefits in the present or future. Letting go is also about stopping being very anxious about the future. In short, it’s about being present in the moment and living the moment without getting emotionally driven by past experience or future uncertainty. This process helps the person get free from emotional burdens and stop taking things personally.</p><p>In life, when we can’t fit into the old shoes, it’s important for us to change the shoes and use a new one so that we can walk and work with flexibility. Similarly, when old memories and experiences do not fit the present situation or life and do not serve it well, it’s important to change them and use new thoughts and beliefs to walk and work better in life. It’s not easy, but it’s necessary to be productive and happy in life. Past experiences are the roots of happiness.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Revamp your love life</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Why is it difficult to let go?</h4><li>People become emotionally attached to bad memories as bad experiences hold highly charged negative energy.</li><li>They can’t accept reality and change the situation.</li><li>Their priorities or important desires are seriously affected because of that experience.</li><li>They believe they deserve proper treatment when they are correct. But it does not always happen.</li><li>They did their best for that person or goal; it’s very difficult for them to accept the situation when it is not in their favor.</li><li>When a very close one had cheated on them. Their faith in humanity and relationships come under question.</li><li>When they lost someone very close to them, expectedly or unexpectedly.</li><li>When they perceive that what they receive in life is entirely unexpected and feels unjustified to them.</li><li>When, due to carelessness, they ruined their own and someone else’s lives.</li><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Important questions to ask yourself if you want to let go:</h4><p>If you want to let go of any person, relationship, event, or experience, it’s very important to ask yourself one question.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>“Why must I let go of this?”</h5><p>This question will generate some serious logic and show us better future possibilities. Think about the positive possibilities, and the more we invest our time in them, the better changes we can create to overcome such memories.<br>Another important question to ask is-</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>“How will my life be affected if I become attached to this memory?”</h5><p>This question will reveal the negative possibilities to us and assist us in cultivating an aversion to becoming attached to such thoughts.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>How to let go:</h4><li>Letting go of past memories is about making conscious efforts. Each time you attempt this, you will notice yourself becoming attached to it or contemplating it again. But gradually, this attachment will reduce with time. The best way is to indulge in some more productive thoughts or actions. I must accept life as it is and make the best out of it. People can change their focus by doing physical exercise, meditation, or self-care. In the beginning, it’s difficult, but keep working on this path without listening to your thoughts, and gradually you will enjoy this process of healing.</li><li>Sometimes people think that such incidents become part of their identity, but they can actually overcome them and change their identity by adding new rational beliefs. In any situation in life, they have the right to choose how they want to respond. So in some way, they can have control over themselves.</li><li>Practice self-compassion and acceptance, as we are all humans and can make mistakes. It’s better to move on with understanding and remembering the learning lessons.</li><li>Be grateful for what you still have; it adds meaning and worth to your life.</li><li>Forgive yourself and that person. Not because they were right, but only because it will set you free. The most painful part of letting go is realizing that the other person has already moved on. In this process, prioritize yourself and think about what you can do to make yourself feel better.</li><li>Instead of searching for a support system, be your own support system. You will find a sense of <a href=#>resilience </a>within yourself to fight whenever it is needed once you realize that no one is going to support you all the time.</li><li>Find your happy zone. What you enjoy and what makes you happy. Once you know this, invest some time into it, and gradually you will find a new self.</li><li>Letting go is not possible until you give yourself time to grieve for what you lost or experienced. While you are in the process of grieving, you will find a way to accept it.</li><p>Acceptance of reality and surrender to a higher being. As humans, we can’t change everything. Accept this fact and let the future unravel it on its own.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Importance of Good Memories in Our Life</a></strong></p><p>Letting go is difficult, but that’s how we can excel in life. Learning from your good and bad experiences in life and focusing on your growth should be the motto of each individual. Find the purpose of your life this New Year. When people are aware of their purpose, they have the courage to face life challenges. Also, work more on what you can instead of wasting your energy on what you can’t.</p>Reference+<ul><li>https://psychcentral.com/blog/how-to-let-go-of-the-past-and-hurt</li><li>https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-let-go-of-someone/</li><li>https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/struggle-let-go-understanding-difficulty-moving-dr-soha-emam#:~:text=Emotional%20attachments%20play%20a%20significant,losing%20a%20part%20of%20ourselves</li></ul><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Positive</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Aham Brahmasmi: Deciding Your Self-Image</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 27, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Positive</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Strategies for Finding Joy in Solo Holidays Moments</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 12, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Positive</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Losing a Soulmate: A Journey of Grief, Loss</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 11, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Positive</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Helpful Breathing Techniques for Meditation</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 9, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Positive</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>The Depths of Indian Psychology: Traditions and Modern</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 5, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmsKCpYrmmwNOipaBll6R6qr%2BMoqSpp6Kprq%2FAjKKlZqSZm7Jw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-letting-go-is-important-in-life.html&text=Why%20letting%20go%20is%20important%20in%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-letting-go-is-important-in-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-letting-go-is-important-in-life.html&title=Why%20letting%20go%20is%20important%20in%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-letting-go-is-important-in-life.html&title=Why%20letting%20go%20is%20important%20in%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-letting-go-is-important-in-life.html&title=Why%20letting%20go%20is%20important%20in%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-letting-go-is-important-in-life.html&description=Why%20letting%20go%20is%20important%20in%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./48-facts-about-ulan-ude.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="48 Facts about Ulan-Ude - Facts.net">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./from-scratch-netflix-viewers-saying-same-thing-zoe-saldana-series.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Netflix's From Scratch: Viewers saying same thing about new Zoe Saldana series">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
