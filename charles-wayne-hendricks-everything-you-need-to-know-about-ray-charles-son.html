He was born under the Libra zodiac sign and had American nationality with black ethnicity.&nbsp;</p><p>Not much is known about Charles Wayne Hendricks’s life because of how private he is. He avoids publicity and has not been seen at any public events recently, so keeping up with him has been difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>While he is the only child his parents welcomed, he has <a href=#>11 other siblings</a>, products of his father’s promiscuity. Ray was known for his love of women, something he once called an obsession.&nbsp;</p><p>It reportedly started when he had his virginity taken from him as a 12-year-old boy by a woman of 20. Since then, he developed an affinity for women and got along well with them, becoming a lady’s man who managed to have many kids with ten different women.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Charles_Wayne_Hendricks_Parents></span>Meet Charles Wayne Hendricks’ Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>His father, Ray Charles, was a talented singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer. His friends and fellow musicians called him “Brother Ray” or referred to him as “the Genius.”&nbsp;</p><p>This probably had to do with how much he was able to achieve even though he was blinded during childhood due to glaucoma. Charles Wayne Hendricks’ mother, Margie, was an American rhythm and blues singer.</p><p>She was a founding member of the Raelettes, women who worked as backup singers for Ray Charles. Charles Wayne Hendricks is the only child his mother and father welcomed together before they eventually parted ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Margie was also a very talented woman. As a teenager, she mastered the piano, sang, and directed her church choir. She joined the band “The Cookies” in 1956 and had a #9 hit before she left in 1958 to found the Raelettes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/margie.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_Between_Ray_Charles_and_Margie></span>What Happened Between Ray Charles and Margie?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As a member of the Raelettes, Margie got involved in a romantic affair with Ray Charles, which led to the birth of their only son, Charles Wayne Hendricks. After his arrival, Margie urged Ray Charles to leave his wife.</p><p>However, he refused to leave his wife to live with her and Charles. Their relationship started going sideways in the 1960s; Margie became addicted to heroin and alcohol, and her career suffered from her addiction.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2.png><p>In July 1964, Ray dismissed Margie from the Raelettes while touring Europe after a heated argument. After her exit, she got signed on Mercury Records, where she released a few singles, none of which gained traction.</p><p>It led her to delve deeper into alcohol and even harder drugs. She reportedly passed away in New York on July 14, 1973, aged 38. The cause of her death remains unknown, as no autopsy was carried out.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is believed she either died of a heroin overdose, cancer, or a car accident. She was buried at New Bethlehem Missionary Baptist Church Cemetery in Register, Georgia.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Charles_Wayne_Hendricks_Childhood></span>Charles Wayne Hendricks Childhood&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marie left the Raelettes with Charles Wayne Hendricks in tow. When she passed away, he was only 14, but Ray Charles did not assume responsibility for him. Instead, he was brought up by his relatives.&nbsp;This could explain why Charles grew up far removed from the buzz of his father’s fame.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Charles_Wayne_Hendricks_Now></span>Charles Wayne Hendricks Now<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Ray Charles</a>‘ son, Charles Wayne Hendricks, lived privately for most of his life, so details of what he did or how he made a living are unavailable. Such details will remain unknown as sources now claim that he passed away in 2013.</p><p>According to his obituary, he married once before he passed on to Marlene Hendricks of Aurora, Colorado, and they reportedly had several children together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksKmt0aWcrGWnlsavsYyhnKecop6wrL%2BMnq2eqqmptaq6xmawqK1do7KmsIytpmajnqTEbq3BqKytZaKWxm6vx5qppZ2jYsCwuo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcharles-wayne-hendricks-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ray-charles-son.html&text=Charles%20Wayne%20Hendricks%3a%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Ray%20Charles%20Son&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcharles-wayne-hendricks-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ray-charles-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcharles-wayne-hendricks-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ray-charles-son.html&title=Charles%20Wayne%20Hendricks%3a%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Ray%20Charles%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcharles-wayne-hendricks-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ray-charles-son.html&title=Charles%20Wayne%20Hendricks%3a%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Ray%20Charles%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcharles-wayne-hendricks-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ray-charles-son.html&title=Charles%20Wayne%20Hendricks%3a%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Ray%20Charles%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcharles-wayne-hendricks-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ray-charles-son.html&description=Charles%20Wayne%20Hendricks%3a%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Ray%20Charles%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nail-technician-claims-turned-minute-appointment-cardi-b-remain-loyal-regular-clients-critics-say-missed-huge-opportunity-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nail technician claims she turned down last-minute appointment with Cardi B to remain 'loyal' to her">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-psychology-behind-your-travel-personality.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Psychology Behind Your Travel Personality">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
