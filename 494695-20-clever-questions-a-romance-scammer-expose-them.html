Most of those who get scammed lack the knowledge to deal with such situations. Fortunately, there are numerous questions to ask a romance scammer to expose them.</p><h2>Cleaver questions to ask a romance scammer</h2><p class=align-left>What are the best romance scammer tactics? One of the ways is to subject them to numerous tactical questions to are likely to expose their lies. Here are some of the questions to help you out.</p><h3>1. Where were you born, and where did you grow up?</h3><p class=align-left>These are questions people ask when they are getting to know someone. Therefore, it does not seem out of place. Most people will find these questions easy to answer, but for a scammer, it is different.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2b04f3497acef93f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>200 killer attitude quotes for girls to show your personality</span></p></a><h3>2. What is your middle name?</h3><p class=align-left>Asking a scammer about their middle name will help you identify whether the relationship you have with them is fake. In most instances, a scammer will be at a loss to give you a middle name and a convincing back story.</p><p class=align-left>They will generally use generic names like Anna, Bob, Sarah, or John. These kinds of names are easy for them to remember.</p><h3>3. How old are you?</h3><p class=align-left>Surprise your scammer by asking them this question. Many people will find sharing their actual age difficult. However, when someone is genuine with you, they'll gladly share.</p><h3>4. What is your current relationship status?</h3><p class=align-left>Most of them will probably say they are single because otherwise, it would be awkward if they have a dating site profile. However, you need to interrogate them about their love life.</p><h3>5. Can we do a video call later?</h3><p class=align-left>A genuine lover would want to see you, and a video call would bother them. However, it will be surprising if a scammer accepts to have a video call with you and even more so if they suggest it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e1626c7a980deebd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do guys text less after a while? 5 most common reasons</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2b04f3497acef93f.jpg><p class=align-left>They are most likely to turn it down if you request a video call. They will make up excuses and avoid video chatting with you.</p><h3>6. Who is your favourite family member, and why?</h3><p class=align-left>It is essential to get the names of their <a href=#>family</a> members. It is so because if they are scammers, it will be easier for you to catch them through their families. Therefore, get them to talk about their family and friends.</p><h3>7. What are you doing right now? Send me a selfie</h3><p class=align-left>The best way to expose a scammer is to ask them what they are doing. However, you need to be ready to pounce when you ask this question. The scammer may be vague and say they are chatting with you.</p><p class=align-left>Request a selfie to see the background and what they are doing. You can as well hit the video call button. The scammer will never answer the video call or send you their selfies.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7286fe16d2ed7836.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ trick questions to ask your friends (with answers)</span></p></a><h3>8. What’s your favourite restaurant in your hometown?</h3><p class=align-left>Asking a scammer about their <a href=#>favourite restaurant</a> in their hometown is essential. It will help you know if they told you the truth about where they come from. It is an easy way to catch a romance scammer out on the lies they tell.</p><h3>9. Do you know (insert a name)?</h3><p class=align-left>Knowing someone in your scammer's circle puts you ahead of them. If you don't know anyone, you can come up with a fictitious friend and relative.</p><h3>10. What was your favourite activity when you were a child?</h3><p class=align-left>People have a favourite activity they did when they were younger, and it can be a family tradition or a ritual they share. Many scammers pretend when they connect with you and play on your sympathies. However, their stories often change to mirror yours.</p><h3>11. When can we meet face-to-face?</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e974b1ad64e30313.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do guys stare but never approach me?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Are you looking for questions to ask a romance scammer? This is one of the best you should ask. Scammers will avoid meeting face-to-face and always have some lame excuse for why they can’t. Therefore, you can be sure that something is off with them.</p><h3>12. Can I have your ID number?</h3><p class=align-left>This is one way to outsmart a romance scammer. It should come at the point where they are asking for your financial assistance. Scammers will never agree to share this information with you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e1626c7a980deebd.jpg><p class=align-left>They will most likely have excuses ready. Therefore, don’t fall for them.</p><h3>13. Where did you go to college?</h3><p class=align-left>If their profile indicates where they studied, you should ask this question to ascertain that. You can then go further to know what course they pursued and what they enjoyed doing during their <a href=#>college</a> days.</p><h3>14. What are your social media handles?</h3><p class=align-left>Did you meet with them online? You should find out about their social media presence. As them for their Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, saying you would want to connect with them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f39ac4e902a235e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>My girlfriend has a celebrity crush: Should I be worried?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Most scammers will deny having social media accounts. This is the first sign that things aren't going well. If their share with you, pay attention to the post and determine how authentic the profile is.</p><h3>15. Can I see your photo?</h3><p class=align-left>If a scammer flatters you by telling you how good your smile is, ask them to send you theirs. They will be agitated and fluster nervously.</p><h3>16. What is your day like?</h3><p class=align-left>Take, for instance, the person who has told you where he works; you need to ask him this question. It’s easy to pick up on inconsistencies and when someone bluffers when sharing information about their day.</p><p class=align-left>The scammer may claim to be in the corporate and working for a given company. If their typical day doesn’t match a description from someone who works in the same role in that company, you’ll know they are lying.</p><h3>17. Can you give me your phone number so we can be in touch regularly?</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7ee533152aa63418.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best pickup lines for Tinder that will get you dates that will pay off</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Romance scammers will probably make up an excuse not to give you their actual phone number. Many will buy new phones and new numbers that they will get rid of once they finish scamming you.</p><p class=align-left>If they give you their number, call or text them at unexpected times. It is a way of catching them if they are lying to you.</p><h3>18. What is your family like?</h3><p class=align-left>You need to focus on crucial details such as their family. Get them talking about it. Scammers may make up a back story about their family but would miss out on some details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/41fd73871c6ee680.jpg><p class=align-left>If you are wondering how to do it, you can start by sending them a picture of you and your family. Then request them to send theirs. Treat as red flags those who do not send theirs.</p><h3>19. What do you do for a living, and where?</h3><p class=align-left>Asking what they do for a living is an excellent way to test a romance scammer. In most cases, scammers would want to sound all-important. Some will not want you to know their places of work.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1d765f7092390a24.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to talk to short people</span></p></a><h3>20.

However, most of them want one thing, money. Their main objective is to trick people into giving them money by masquerading as love seekers.</p><p class=align-left>The online dating <a href=#>world</a> can be scary if you think about how many people are being scammed daily.
