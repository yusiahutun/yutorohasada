She has earned a good amount of money as an American painter, novelist, and socialite.</p><p>The information about the Brand Endorsement of Zelda Fitzgerald is not updated yet.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Zelda Fitzgerald asked to write a review of ‘The Beautiful and Damned’ for the New York Tribune in 1922, she revealed that Scott lifted material from her diaries in her typical cheeky fashion. Likewise, she received offers to write for magazines because this review was well written.</p><p>Moreover, she wrote an essay, ‘Eulogy On The Flapper’ in June 1922, for the ‘Metropolitan’ Magazine. In this essay, she defended her own unconventional and audacious existence and mourned the decline of the flapper lifestyle.</p><p>In 1923, she continued writing several short stories and articles and helped her husband write the play, ‘The Vegetable’. Furthermore, the play flopped, and due to their extravagant lifestyle, they found themselves in debt.</p><p>Additionally, they moved to Antibes on the French Riviera where she became infatuated with a French aviator, Edouard Jozan. Later on, the affair blew away but her relationship with her husband became embittered beyond repair.</p><p>She started painting as a hobby and in 1924 her short essay, ‘Does A Moment Of Revolt Come Sometime To Every Married Man?’, appeared in the magazine, ‘McCall’s’. Scott met Ernest Hemingway in 1925 and became thick friends with him. Moreover, She even accused her husband of having a homosexual affair with Hemingway.</p><h4><span>More about her career</span></h4><p>Moreover, she was invited to join the ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company In 1929,&nbsp; in Naples, but she declined.&nbsp; She was diagnosed as schizophrenic and admitted to a sanatorium in France in 1930. Later on, her father’s death and Scott’s leaving for Hollywood took their toll and she returned to the sanatorium.</p><p>Scott died working on his last novel, ‘The Love of the Last Tycoon’ in 1940. To edit the work she convinced Edmund Wilson, the literary critic. Additionally, after Scott’s death, she began working on a novel, ‘Caesar’s Things’ which she never completed.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>In New York, she and Scott <strong>married</strong> at St Patrick’s Cathedral in 1920. Later on, the couple became well-known for their wild behavior. Zelda gave birth to Frances “Scottie” Fitzgerald in 1921.</p><p>When she became pregnant again in 1922 she presumably had an abortion. Moreover, this incident found its way into Scott’s novel, ‘The Beautiful and Damned’.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/zelda-fitzgerald-Over-the-moon.jpg alt="zelda fitzgerald" width=650 height=432 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Caption: Zelda with her husband.
