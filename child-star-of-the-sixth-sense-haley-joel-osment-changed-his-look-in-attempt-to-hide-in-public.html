When contemplating the great child actors, names like <a href=#>Macaulay Culkin</a> (<a href=#>Home Alone</a>), Dakota Fanning (Man On Fire), <a href=#>Emma Watson</a> (<a href=#>Harry Potter</a>), and Tatum O’Neal (Paper Moon) are cited for good reason. At the head of the conversation, you’ll often find the name Haley Joel Osment. He was celebrated as a breakout talent for the 1999 M. Night Shyamalan thriller The Sixth Sense, and yes, he’s still in <a href=#>movies</a>…</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-90999179-1006x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-haley-joel-osment-grew-beard-to-try-to-hide-in-public>Haley Joel Osment grew beard to ‘try to hide in public’</h2><p>After his first role as Forrest Gump Jr. in the 1994 <a href=#>Tom Hanks</a> classic, the young actor was just 10 years old when working on The Sixth Sense, in which he starred alongside <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a> as a troubled boy with the ability to see the dead.</p><p>The acclaim opened up the doors to opportunities in such big movies as Pay It Forward and A.I. Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>What happened to him? you may hear people ask when discussing films now and then, and the answer is he’s still acting. After years in the spotlight as a child, at the age of 18, he relocated from Los Angeles to study experimental theatre at New York University in 2006. It was during these days that the stream of high-profile film releases simmered down.</p><p>“I did work that practically nobody saw for a long time, which was not a great career move –<br>but, ultimately, was important for me to figure out whether this was what I truly wanted to do for the rest of my life,” he explained during an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> with The Guardian.</p><p>For example, he debuted on Broadway in 2008 playing the role of a drug addict in a reimagining of David Mamet’s American Buffalo. Following his graduation, he would continue to tackle challenging roles that distanced himself further from the image his previous work had sculpted for him.</p><p>His work throughout the 2010s includes movies from Entourage to the Ted Bundy biopic Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil And Vile starring <a href=#>Zac Efron</a>. “That was definitely a very fun period of playing a lot of bad guys,” he recalled.</p><p>It was during this time that he attempted to change his image to set himself apart from his child star days, and even grew a beard in hopes he could “try to hide in public.” Was it a success?</p><p>“That didn’t really work at all,” he admits.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-haley-joel-osment-been-up-to-recently>What has Haley Joel Osment been up to recently?</h2><p>In the 2020s, Haley starred on live-action shows like the TV drama Goliath (he played Dylan Zax) with Billy Bob Thornton and the vampire comedy What We Do In The Shadows (Topher Delmonico).</p><p>There has also been an assortment of voicing acting roles, from Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous to Young Jedi Adventures.</p><p>As for movies, he was in the 2023 rom-com Somebody I Used To Know on Prime Video, with his latest role being in the 2024 crime-comedy Drugstore June. Looking ahead, he’ll be in Zoë Kravitz’s directorial feature debut Blink Twice, a thriller about a waitress traveling to a tech mogul’s private island that stars Channing Tatum.</p><p>“I just feel lucky that I’m able to do something that I’ve done since I was a very young age,” he previously <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> The Independent, “and continue to have that be my job today.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2Z%2FcK%2FHoqOdZaOprrN5zp9kraCVYsCqxNOhZKydnqiybrTApZyyZZqksq15zqyknqakYrCprc2gnJ1lmJ7AbrjOqKJmoZ5irrXAxKanrWWkpHqptcOeZKKmXaXCo7jInGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchild-star-of-the-sixth-sense-haley-joel-osment-changed-his-look-in-attempt-to-hide-in-public.html&text=Child%20star%20of%20The%20Sixth%20Sense%20Haley%20Joel%20Osment%20changed%20his%20look%20in%20attempt%20%27to%20hide%20in%20public%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchild-star-of-the-sixth-sense-haley-joel-osment-changed-his-look-in-attempt-to-hide-in-public.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchild-star-of-the-sixth-sense-haley-joel-osment-changed-his-look-in-attempt-to-hide-in-public.html&title=Child%20star%20of%20The%20Sixth%20Sense%20Haley%20Joel%20Osment%20changed%20his%20look%20in%20attempt%20%27to%20hide%20in%20public%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchild-star-of-the-sixth-sense-haley-joel-osment-changed-his-look-in-attempt-to-hide-in-public.html&title=Child%20star%20of%20The%20Sixth%20Sense%20Haley%20Joel%20Osment%20changed%20his%20look%20in%20attempt%20%27to%20hide%20in%20public%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchild-star-of-the-sixth-sense-haley-joel-osment-changed-his-look-in-attempt-to-hide-in-public.html&title=Child%20star%20of%20The%20Sixth%20Sense%20Haley%20Joel%20Osment%20changed%20his%20look%20in%20attempt%20%27to%20hide%20in%20public%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchild-star-of-the-sixth-sense-haley-joel-osment-changed-his-look-in-attempt-to-hide-in-public.html&description=Child%20star%20of%20The%20Sixth%20Sense%20Haley%20Joel%20Osment%20changed%20his%20look%20in%20attempt%20%27to%20hide%20in%20public%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./halle-bailey-ddg-relationship-timeline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Halle Bailey and DDG's Complete Relationship Timeline">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./white-jeans-outfits.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="9 Stylish White Jeans Outfits for Every Occasion">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
