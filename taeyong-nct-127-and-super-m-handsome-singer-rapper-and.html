His career started when he was scouted in his second year studying at Seoul’s School of Performing Arts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The talent scout did not reveal the company he represented, only saying it was one of the “Big Three” – meaning JYP Entertainment, SM Entertainment and YG Entertainment, the largest idol agencies in South Korea.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why K-pop fans should be kept out of airports</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But knowing little about the idol world, Taeyong thought “Big Three” referred to the three major Korean television broadcasters and thought he was being recruited by a TV station. It turned out the scout was from SM Entertainment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When he visited SM Entertainment’s offices in Apgujeong-dong, in Seoul’s Gangnam district, in 2012, it was his first time in the affluent area that is home to many idol agencies. Taeyong did not know any songs apart from the national anthem, so he sang that for the audition while showcasing his basic dancing skills.</p>After a successful audition, the 18-year-old joined the SM Rookies, an SM Entertainment group used to publicise the progress of its trainees. Four years later in 2016, Taeyong made his debut as part of NCT U and then NCT 127, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">NCT</span></a>’s subunit based in Seoul.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/02/27/ea5e931c-579b-11ea-b438-8452af50d521_972x_044916.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Taeyong’s role in NCT 127</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Usually called “TY” by other NCT members, Taeyong is the group’s leader, lead dancer, main rapper and frontman. Taeyong said during a live stream that while his greatest strength was now in dancing, when he became a trainee his dance teacher told him he was so bad that there was almost no hope for him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But after a year-and-a-half of training, Taeyong gradually moved from practising at the back of the dance room to the front as his technique improved. And by the time of his debut, he was front and centre in the SM Rookies and one of the most skilled dancers in SM Entertainment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even in his early years, Taeyong was making a name for himself as a rapper. Less than a year after SM Entertainment announced him as a member of SM Rookies, the company published a music video of the rap track Open the Door, featuring Taeyong dropping rhymes in a smoke-filled studio.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Three months after Open the Door, he was featured as a rapper in girl group Red Velvet’s single Be Natural.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition to his roles on stage, Taeyong has also written songs, including the lyrics for NCT U’s first single The 7th Sense and Fire Truck, the single that launched NCT 127. He made his composing debut as a co-writer of Baby Don’t Like It, a hip-hop track on NCT 127’s second EP, “NCT #127 Limitless”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Taeyong’s solo career</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taeyong has still not made his debut as a solo artist, but in June 2019 he released his first solo track, Long Flight. He wrote the track’s lyrics and also co-wrote the music.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">SM Entertainment last year also announced he was to become a member of the company’s Avengers-like K-pop supergroup, SuperM. Taeyong co-wrote the track No Manners in the supergroup’s self-titled debut EP.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Taeyong’s image</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taeyong is the main man for NCT’s “visuals” – one of those considered the most physically attractive in a group. From his ice-white hair in the music video for NCT 127’s hit single The 7th Sense, to the scarlet locks he sported at the 2018 Korea Popular Music Awards, Taeyong’s ever-changing hair colour is iconic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Besides his hair, he is also known for his thick dark brows, which NCT vocalist Jaehyun has said are the leader’s best feature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/02/27/f17ebaf0-579b-11ea-b438-8452af50d521_972x_044916.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">In his own words</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taeyong may now be known for his looks, but he told Naver TV in 2017 that he previously did not like the shape of his face and he knew he did not have the “SM look” preferred by SM Entertainment founder, Lee Soo-man.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But talking of Lee Soo-man reminds me of an interesting story. It was very touching. After the SMTown Live show in Tokyo ended, we went for a meal, and I was hiding behind the many artists there,” he said in the interview.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Lee Soo-man came to me and said: ‘Taeyong, you must be very tired.’ I felt there was a new bond between Mr Lee and me. I was so touched that I hid in the toilet of the SMTown Live venue and cried.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I felt that as I was growing, he had been watching me throughout. But although I don’t have the SM look, I will continue to work hard and earn Mr Lee Soo-man’s applause.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COmqmtoZOhsnB%2Fj25pbWhpZMGisdiopaBlnpjBbn2RcGSappRiwLa8xKtkpmWYlrulv86mnGarmaO0pr6Mq5ipqJWneqK6ww%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaeyong-nct-127-and-super-m-handsome-singer-rapper-and.html&text=Taeyong%20of%20NCT%20127%20and%20Super%20M%3a%20handsome%20singer%2c%20rapper%20and%20dancer%20didnt%20always%20have%20all%20the%20righ&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaeyong-nct-127-and-super-m-handsome-singer-rapper-and.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaeyong-nct-127-and-super-m-handsome-singer-rapper-and.html&title=Taeyong%20of%20NCT%20127%20and%20Super%20M%3a%20handsome%20singer%2c%20rapper%20and%20dancer%20didnt%20always%20have%20all%20the%20righ" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaeyong-nct-127-and-super-m-handsome-singer-rapper-and.html&title=Taeyong%20of%20NCT%20127%20and%20Super%20M%3a%20handsome%20singer%2c%20rapper%20and%20dancer%20didnt%20always%20have%20all%20the%20righ" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaeyong-nct-127-and-super-m-handsome-singer-rapper-and.html&title=Taeyong%20of%20NCT%20127%20and%20Super%20M%3a%20handsome%20singer%2c%20rapper%20and%20dancer%20didnt%20always%20have%20all%20the%20righ" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaeyong-nct-127-and-super-m-handsome-singer-rapper-and.html&description=Taeyong%20of%20NCT%20127%20and%20Super%20M%3a%20handsome%20singer%2c%20rapper%20and%20dancer%20didnt%20always%20have%20all%20the%20righ" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paypal-mobile-pay-paypal-account.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Use PayPal Mobile To Pay On The Go With Your Paypal Account">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sean-combs-apologizes-for-assaulting-cassie-ventura.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sean Combs Apologizes For Assaulting Cassie Ventura">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
