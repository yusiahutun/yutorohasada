He considers it a personal alternative for fans who, for example, don’t have the opportunity to sport logo tees in public. “They probably can't wear it outside because they have to wear a suit and tie to work, so this gives everybody the opportunity to be part of the brand,” Ferg said over the phone.</p><img alt="Clothing, Brown, Sleeve, Trousers, Jacket, Collar, Textile, Standing, Outerwear, White, " title="Clothing, Brown, Sleeve, Trousers, Jacket, Collar, Textile, Standing, Outerwear, White, " width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-ferg-rocky-mfw-1496424549.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>A$AP Ferg and A$AP Rocky at the Dior Haute Couture show in January.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it comes to style and the A$AP Mob collective, A$AP Rocky is usually the one receiving praise from the fashion world, especially as a frequent fashion week front-row attendee, face of Dior Homme, design collaborator with Guess and arm candy for one of the industry’s biggest models, Kendall Jenner. But his fellow rapper, 28-year-old Ferg, has had a longer relationship with fashion than many would assume. He went to art school, and started a clothing line called Devoni at the age of 15, where he designed high-end belts that ended up on Chris Brown and Swizz Beatz. His father even owned a boutique in Harlem and printed shirts for record companies like Bad Boy Records. “I went from painting to making clothes to rapping,” Ferg’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.asapferg.com/about/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="official bio" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">official bio</a> reads.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His collaboration with Fancy isn’t even his first; he’s previously teamed up with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://sneakernews.com/2015/11/04/aap-ferg-joins-adidas-and-launches-his-first-sneaker-collaboration/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Adidas class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Adidas</a> for a sneaker and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://hypebeast.com/2017/4/asap-ferg-traplord-uniform-2017-collection data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Uniform data-vars-ga-product-id=4d704a06-0334-4daa-875c-9f8b6cf33cca data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://hypebeast.com/2017/4/asap-ferg-traplord-uniform-2017-collection data-product-url=https://hypebeast.com/2017/4/asap-ferg-traplord-uniform-2017-collection data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2F2017%2F4%2Fasap-ferg-traplord-uniform-2017-collection" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=ca5d3b16-f090-4559-b1d1-721fa19cf86a class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Uniform</a> for apparel. The rapper’s venture into home goods is just his latest step in expanding his Traplord brand. (He cites Ralph Lauren as one of his biggest influences.) Plus, he’s working on new music and touring with Future, Migos, Tory Lanez and Zoey Dollaz. “We already sold out every venue,” he said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>During his downtime from the Nobody Safe Tour, Ferg talked to BAZAAR.com about his new collection, design tips and upcoming album.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You can visit A$AP Ferg's Traplord home collection pop-up shop at: 282 St. Nicholas Ave. (between 124th and 125th Streets) New York, NY 10027 on Friday, June 2 and Saturday, June 3 from 12:00 to 8:00 pm each day.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On what motivated him to go into home decor:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>It's just something different. I always think about new ways to expand my brand. What else is better than wearing a hoodie with your logo on, or your t-shirt with your logo—that's home goods, you know? Some people who are grown older would much rather have the logo secret or decorate their house, have the décor on the rug or the curtains or in their home versus wearing it outside. They probably can't wear it outside because they have to wear a suit and tie to work, so this gives everybody the opportunity to be part of the brand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>That’s something I've always wanted to do since I've seen how Ralph Lauren expanded his brand, grown into doing paints, utensils, plates. I got a bunch of different vintage Ralph Lauren dishes and things like that. I thought about it and why not? Why not experience a brand of Traplord and do something good like home goods so people can put it in their homes.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On whether the collection reflects the way he designs his own home:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>It's royal. I like to think with the logo and everything, that's our badge of honor with the doves and everything like that. We kept it very subtle, we didn't want to be too loud with everything. So whenever you see like a logo everywhere, it's basically embossed into the fabric of the garment. ‘Cause I hate everything being logos, I’m very much more into the fit, the way it builds and the coziness. So I don't want to bombard it with too much things. I want it to be very minimal and colors will make it pop and the fabric will make people fall in love with it. It’s very minimal, but at the same time gives you touch of the Traplord flavor.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On designing with college students in mind:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>When I created this home goods collection, I was designing for myself and I was designing for a college student. A lot of college kids, they don't have the funds to purchase a lot of things, you know, if they do purchase something, it has to be functional. I want to make sure I have functionality. That's why I created the bean bag. You can sit there, you can do your homework. You've got the pillow, nap before you've got to go into your next class. One of your friends could just crash there. It's just like a fun trinket. It's not standard like a couch. Anybody could sit there and you wouldn't have a problem. It has the logo and it comes in two different colors.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On his love for scented candles:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>I'm a big collector of candles. I collect candles from Japan or wherever I go, I bring them back. I'm very much into cologne and scents so I wanted to create a cool candle with my logo on the side.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On being inspired by Hermès:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>I always loved Hermes towels, just the quality, how heavy, how the logo stood out on it, it had a huge color that popped on it. So I went and used oranges or all black or a yellow logo on it, just to make it pop.</p><img alt="Symbol, Logo, Font, Emblem, Circle, Graphics, Trademark, Brand, Artwork, Label, " title="Symbol, Logo, Font, Emblem, Circle, Graphics, Trademark, Brand, Artwork, Label, " width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-traplord-clock-1496424360.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On his favorite piece in the collection:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>The clock is one of my favorites because was the clock has one of my favorite t-shirt designs, with the city and the globe behind it. I feel like, once you're the guy, the boss, you feel like you’re the biggest, the king of the city. I would like to fancy myself Mr. East Coast. I'm the biggest. I'm the East Coast. So, for me that city represents New York City. Which is on the clock with the globe behind it, meaning we've got the globe on our back. But that could be Chicago, that could be for wherever. It’s abstract.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On how his interior design style relates to his music style:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>Everything is nostalgic. Everything is a dead-on experience that I've encountered in my life. When I write music there some type of truth. Whether it's about a dream that I had or a story of seeing my uncle or my father doing things growing up. Same thing with clothing, when it comes to designing it's something that I use the machine in my grandfather's closet or I see in my uncle's closet. Just recreating these memories.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"When I write music there some type of truth."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On what he hopes to do with his brand next:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I dream to have a company as big as Ralph Lauren, if not bigger, with different branches, different tiers, of brands. He has Chaps, Polo, Ralph Lauren, Purple Label, Black Label and Double RL—all of these different levels that you can buy into his brand. I dream to have the same brand as him. Where everyone can afford it on different levels. You can buy really exclusive pieces all the way down to a piece that costs about $10 that you can buy anywhere. So, that's what I plan to do.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On the status of his next album, Still Striving:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That's going to have a lot of dope songs, a lot of turn-up records, I’m excited to drop that. It’s pretty much done already, all the samples are getting cleared. I’m working on videos and visuals for these songs, so as soon as we get further along with that process, we should have another project out. So I'm presuming it should be somewhere during tour or right on the leg of getting out of tour.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On having quality visuals for his next project, like those on his single “East Coast” with Remy Ma:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>There's a lot that goes into creating good visuals and finding the right place to shoot. I come up with all my treatments myself. It's just a lot to really nail it, so I want the people to know, they've been waiting for a project, it's coming. It took a while, but that's because of the quality.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On how Still Striving compares to his last LP, Always Strive and Prosper:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>Always Strive and Prosper was more a documentary of my life. I've got songs about my uncle. I've got songs about my mom and my grandmother and just my family members and trials and tribulations of my life. Aesthetically, it was a very serious project. With Still Striving, I just wanted to continue what I was doing. As the quality of the music, I wanted it to be more fun, more turned up. People will have way more fun. The other album was very introspective, very serious, just sitting in a car for a long ride, listening to the lyrics. There's kind of nitpicking what you wanted to listen to because it was very thought-provoking. With this album, it's still thought-provoking but you have those beats that's going to get you to move and dance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
