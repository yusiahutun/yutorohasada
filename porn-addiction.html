JENN,</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm in my early twenties and just started watching porn. I liked it more than I expected. Like, I'm really into it. I watch it every day. Is that too much — or totally normal? How much is too much? — Me So Porny</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>DEAR PORNY,</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's no shame in a bit of porn viewing. As it was said in the show Avenue Q, "the internet is for porn." And, as it turns out, so are your phone, iPad, and computer. Pornhub, considered the most popular site for free porn, averaged <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2.5 billion visits per month</a> in 2022. In fact, it gets <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>more visits</a> than Netflix and TikTok! To put this in perspective, Starbucks goes through 4 billion cups annually. So, porn is more popular than everyone's favorite coffee — like, by far.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the end of each year, Pornhub does a "Year in Review" and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>most recent top trending search</a> term is "hentai," which is a pornographic form of anime — with "lesbian" and "milf" not too far behind. The most recent Google Analytics data show that the audience for PornHub is<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow> 35% female</a>. The point is, you aren't alone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're worried about whether you have a pornography addiction, it has to do with more than just time spent. Porn can be a healthy part of a solo or partnered sex life. It can also become compulsive, addictive, and hard on a relationship. To better understand what makes a good or bad outcome (i.e., if your habits are more like a porn addiction), it is helpful to look at a<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> study</a> that puts people who watch porn into three different categories: recreational, highly distressed non-compulsive, and compulsive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Recreational users, about 75% of the people looked at in the study, averaged 24 minutes of viewing per week. This group had a high number of women and people in relationships. They showed higher levels of sexual satisfaction and lower levels of sexual compulsivity, avoidance, and dysfunction. In other words, their porn viewing was moderate, they were happy with their sex lives, they weren't acting out in ways that made them feel bad sexually, they were having sex with their partners, and when they did, they were not having sexual problems.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The distressed non-compulsive group, a little over 12% of the sample, only watched 17 minutes a week. They were not compulsive about it but experienced a lot of emotional distress about their viewing, feeling uncomfortable and shameful about it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The compulsive group, which was a little over 11%, represents people who will rearrange their schedule in order to watch porn, they feel powerless to stop viewing, are more likely to be isolated, are preoccupied with thoughts about porn and sex — and feel enormous shame about their viewing habits. Those with a compulsive profile reported lower rates of sexual satisfaction and dysfunction and higher rates of sexual compulsivity and avoidance. The highly distressed users were less sexually satisfied and reported less sexual compulsivity but experienced more sexual dysfunction and avoidance. In other words, those users were not enjoying sex, they felt out of control with their viewing habits and were more likely to avoid sex with a partner and when they did have it, they were more likely to have sexual problems.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reading these descriptions, you should be able to determine which sounds most like you. To be sure your porn use is "normal," or safe for you and your life, you want to keep your use moderate and come to terms with it so you can avoid the shame spiral.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here are a few things to keep in mind to have a healthy relationship with porn.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dont-overdo-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Don't Overdo It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>study of porn watching</a> and gray matter found a negative association between reported hours of porn viewing per week and gray matter volume. This has been linked to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>decreased motivation</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>reward processing</a>. In other words, more porn viewing led to people being less motivated to do things in their life and less responsive to sexual stimuli, meaning it would require more graphic images for them to have a sexual response. People who watched more porn were less able to have sexual reactions when they were with a real-life partner. This does not translate well to a healthy sex life.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-switch-it-up></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Switch it Up</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In order to avoid becoming porn dependent to get off, vary your repertoire. Don't use it all the time. Use fantasy, read erotica, and look at photos of hot people on Instagram. Do whatever it takes to get yourself turned on — including watching porn — but mix up your routine.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-share-your-porn></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Share Your Porn</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you are in a relationship, watching porn together can be a fun way to spice things up. Try opening up to your partner about what you've been watching. Ask their porn preferences, and you've got even more to try out together — just be sure you don't judge what gets them off in private. If it's something you want no part of, politely decline and pivot to something else you can share.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dont-judge-yourself-either></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Don't Judge Yourself, Either</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The things that turn us on often have to do with power, control, and dominance, which can feel like murky waters to wade into. But rest assured it's perfectly natural to fantasize about (or enjoy watching porn about) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sexual scenarios</a> you would never want to engage in real life. Your porn preferences do not have to be politically correct. (For example, one of PornHub's consistent high searches is for "stepmom.") Resist the urge to overanalyze yourself mid-orgasm.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-look-out-for-warning-signs-and-symptoms></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Look Out for Warning Signs and Symptoms</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you find that you are getting to the point you need more and more graphic material to get off, this is a sign that you are becoming desensitized and need to back off. Also, if you are finding that you are neglecting your responsibilities in order to stay home and watch porn that is another red flag (and a sign of porn addiction). If these things occur, in addition to reducing your viewing, you may want to consult a professional who specializes in mental health disorders, or even sexual behavior.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pick-people-over-porn></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pick People Over Porn</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you find that you are avoiding IRL sex, this could be about intimacy issues and have nothing to do with porn. If you are avoiding connecting with people, not just sexually, that is a problem. Make sure you spend time developing your friendships, connecting with family, and pursuing real-life experiences over screen time with your favorite porn stars. If you are resistant to those real-life connections, it is worth exploring in therapy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The big question you ask is, how much porn is healthy? There's no specific number. What is healthy is the amount that allows you to still be aroused and have fun without a need for more extreme images. Healthy porn viewing enhances your life, it does not prevent you from feeling turned on with a partner. Obsessing about it, shaming yourself over it, shirking your responsibilities to watch it, or being dependent on it to orgasm are signs your use has gotten unhealthy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8eupKlllJbGcLzOq6VmmZSZtqTAyKil</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fporn-addiction.html&text=How%20Much%20Porn%20Is%20Too%20Much%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fporn-addiction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fporn-addiction.html&title=How%20Much%20Porn%20Is%20Too%20Much%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fporn-addiction.html&title=How%20Much%20Porn%20Is%20Too%20Much%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fporn-addiction.html&title=How%20Much%20Porn%20Is%20Too%20Much%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fporn-addiction.html&description=How%20Much%20Porn%20Is%20Too%20Much%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jodie-fletcher.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Player Terrell Fletcher Bio, Who is his Wife &amp;amp; Daughter?
