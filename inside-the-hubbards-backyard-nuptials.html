Lauren grew up in the jewelry business and owns LK Bridal Designs and Anchor Jewelers in Stuart. “I didn’t want to underwhelm someone who sees and hears a lot of great stories from guys who do a really good job [with their proposal],” Robbie says.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2>The couple first met on Facebook in 2017—Lauren made the first move. “I saw his picture in the ‘People You May Know’ section, and one of my friends urged me to friend request him with a message,” recalls Lauren. “She said, ‘What’s the worst that can happen?’ So I did.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/09/The-bride-center-pops-some-celebratory-Champagne-with-her-bridal-party-including-her-daughter-Sophia.-Photo-by-S.J.C.-Photography-911x1024.jpg><p class=p2>He replied, and they exchanged numbers. Two weeks later, they met up in person.</p><p class=p2>“He texted me, ‘I’m going to the golf course if you want to meet me there,’” Lauren recalls. “I replied that I had my daughter with me, and he was like, ‘Cool, I have my son.’ So we both brought our kids, who were both in kindergarten at the time, and met for the first time at Palm Cove Golf Course.”</p><p class=p2>It was a perfect pairing, and a year later, Robbie and his son moved into Lauren’s Port St. Lucie home. The following November, he proposed at Fort Pierce’s White City Park. “It was just before my thirtieth birthday,” <span class=s1>Lauren says. “My best friend Jessica came into my store and handed</span> me a manila envelope from Robbie with a note inside saying my birthday weekend was starting now and I had to turn over my car keys and get into Jessica’s car.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/09/The-groom-center-with-his-groomsmen-which-included-his-son-Cameron-on-the-grooms-right.-Photo-by-S.J.C.-Photography-902x1024.jpg><p class=p2>Inside the car, she found a gift—a pair of Tory Burch sandals and an iPad containing a video with memorable moments from the past year that Robbie had personalized with music. For the next half hour, Lauren was on a scavenger hunt, making stops at boutiques like Monkee’s of Stuart, where gifts like a blue dress Lauren had once admired online and a diamond-monogrammed Yeti cup were waiting. When she and Jessica returned to the car, they found snowboarding goggles, ski passes, and airline tickets—departing to Breckenridge, Colorado in six hours. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/09/The-wedding-invitations-rings-and-more-wedding-day-items.-Photo-by-S.J.C.-Photography-300x233.jpg><p class=p2>The next stop on the scavenger hunt was White City Park, and as they made a loop around the lake, Lauren spotted Robbie standing there with both of their children. She didn’t notice the photographer hiding a few yards away: “The only thing I remember is looking at Jessica like, ‘Holy [expletive], is this happening?’ and her forcing me out of the car because I was frozen.”</p><p class=p2>It was there that Robbie proposed with a ring that Lauren had unknowingly fashioned for herself. “A few months before, I had attended a five-day jewelry conference in Louisiana,” she explains. “At the time, Robbie was helping me with marketing so he came with me.” In one of the sessions she attended, participants used computer-aided design to conceive the engagement ring of their dreams—and Robbie was paying attention. He sent her design off to be professionally cast. “I had no idea he had put the whole thing together,” says Lauren.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/09/Lauren-and-Robbie-take-a-photo-with-their-large-wedding-party.-Photo-by-S.J.C.-Photography-1024x676.jpg><p class=p2>After the proposal, the couple headed to Casa Amigos in Port St. Lucie to celebrate with friends and family members before departing for their quick trip to Breckenridge. When they returned from Colorado, they agreed that the wedding planning would have to wait. The couple wanted to prioritize having their first baby together, whom they named Colby. Then they were busy moving into a larger home in Palm City. And then they learned they were expecting another baby—this time a girl, Spencer—in May 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/09/The-brides-rings.-Photo-by-S.J.C.-Photography-300x235.jpg><p class=p2>With a new home base and two new kids in their growing family, the couple was now ready to get down to wedding business. Robbie’s own parents had tied the knot at home, and he and Lauren decided a small backyard wedding was exactly what they wanted. To help them plan the perfect day, they turned to Jade Smith of Stuart-based Island Party Rentals and Unearthed Rentals, whom Lauren had known for many years and even designed her engagement ring.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2>For the overall design, the bride wanted an elegant and bohemian-chic aesthetic. “We included lots of natural colors and combined them with deeper hues like terracotta, rust, and slate blue,” Smith says. One important and unique element? “Market lighting!” Lauren says, referring to the trendy and delicate string lights. “They have a modern look that I absolutely love. My favorite elements were the lights and the neon sign with our name.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/09/The-Hubbards-with-their-blended-family-of-four-children—Robbies-son-Cameron-Sophia-and-the-couples-two-youngest-Colby-and-Spencer.-Photo-by-S.J.C.-Photography-707x1024.jpg><p class=p2>On February 4, 2023, 200 of the couple’s closets friends and family members gathered under those market lights to celebrate Lauren and Robbie on their wedding day. As guests strolled into the couple’s backyard, local musician Alexa Kajangu performed Jason Mraz covers and soulful ballads by crooners like Jack Johnson. They nibbled on hors d’oeuvres from Chef’s Table and drank signature tipples served from a circular, 20-foot bar crowned with the couple’s last name in neon lights. In a boho-imbued lounge area, guests could mingle and relax, and a photo booth bus courtesy of Good Times Roll was parked on site to capture all the memories.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/09/The-reception-table-settings-were-designed-with-a-boho-chic-vibe-and-incorporated-elements-of-nature.-Photo-by-S.J.C.-Photography-1-274x300.jpg><p class=p2>The bride, stunning in an A-line dress by Essence of Australia, walked down the aisle with a bouquet of roses, pampas, and wildflowers as Kajangu sang a tear-jerking rendition of Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” The groom looked dapper in a light blue State & Liberty suit, floral necktie, and white Nike Air Force 1 shoes that matched his groomsmen.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s2>Immanuel Lutheran Church’s lead pastor, Chad Fair, officiated the ceremony and delighted everyone with a humorous speech laced with golf jokes—and jabbed at the time it took for the couple to tie the knot. “It was a long</span>standing joke with Robbie’s mother, who said she wrote our wedding date in pencil because of how many times we changed it,” Lauren says, laughing.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/09/The-newlyweds-enjoy-taking-in-the-scene-of-their-reception-amid-the-neon-lights.-Photo-by-S.J.C.-Photography-764x1024.jpg><p class=p2><span class=s1>After the couple exchanged vows, guests enjoyed a post-ceremony</span> cocktail hour while the bridal party rushed to take photos before the last rays of sunlight dipped beneath the horizon. When they returned to the reception, it was time to party. As the bridesmaids hit the glossy dance floor edged with marquee letters, they waved glow sticks to the beat of Shania Twain’s “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!” Then it was the groomsmen’s turn, who formed a huddle before strutting in to the NFL Sunday theme song. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/09/Wedding-cake-by-Desserts-by-Dominique-of-Stuart.-Photo-by-S.J.C.-Photography-251x300.jpg><p class=p2>Dinner was a swanky, buffet-style feast with options like filet mignon carving stations, a live-action pasta bar, and a do-it-your<span class=s1>self mashed bar. Desserts included carrot cake, Funfetti, red velvet </span>cupcakes from Publix Martin Downs, and a pint-sized layered masterpiece of lemon cake and raspberry compote. During dinner, the newlyweds shared their first dance, and by the time the father-daughter dance wrapped, everyone was on the dance floor. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2>When the festivities wound down just after 11 p.m., some of the bridal party and their spouses wanted to keep the party going at a local bar. Trying not to be party poopers, the exhausted newlyweds boarded the rented bus and headed to a pub in town. But with four young kids at home, they were out of practice with the late-night scene. “Normally, we go to bed the same time as our kids, so staying up that late was really a thrill,” says Lauren. “But Robbie and I were so tired, we made it as far as the Harpers parking lot.”</p><h3 class=p1>Sourcebook</h3><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Wedding planner and rentals:</b></span><span class=s2><a href=# rel=noopener> Unearthed Rentals</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Island Party Rentals</a>, Stuart&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s4><b>Flowers: </b></span><a href=# rel=noopener>Sarandipity Floral</a>, Port St. Luci</p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Catering and bar: </b></span><span class=s3>Chef’s Table, Stuart<br></span><i>(chefstablestuart.com)</i></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Wedding cake: </b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener>Desserts by Dominique</a>, Stuart<br></span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Wedding rings:</b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener> LK Bridal Designs</a>, Stuart<br></span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Bridal gown:</b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener> Nicole Maree Bridal</a>, Melbourne<br></span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Bride’s jewelry: </b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener>Anchor Jewelers & Rare Coins</a>, Stuart</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Bride’s hair and makeup: </b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener>Salt Beauty Bar</a>, Fort Pierce</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Bridesmaid dresses: </b></span><a href=# rel=noopener><span class=s3>Revelry</span></a></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Bridesmaid jewelry:</b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener> Abundant Gems Co.</a>, Jensen Beach&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Groom’s suit: </b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener>State & Liberty</a>, Miami<br></span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Groomsmen suit: </b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener>Men’s Wearhouse</a>, Stuart</span><i><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Groom and groomsmen hair: </b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener>Maxx’s Shaving Room</a>, Stuart</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Signage: </b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener>Sign Jungle</a>, Stuart</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Marquee letters: </b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener>De Gala Events</a>, West Palm Beach&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Photo booth bus:</b></span><span class=s3><a href=# rel=noopener> Good Times Roll Bus</a>, Miami</span><i><br></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMC1wcCrq2akmZuycLzEqKelnV%2Beu7S1w55kraCVYrW2rsGaqZ2rXZeupLfYmqmdZZ6qvbW1wKWqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-the-hubbards-backyard-nuptials.html&text=Inside%20The%20Hubbards%20Backyard%20Nuptials&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-the-hubbards-backyard-nuptials.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-hubbards-backyard-nuptials.html&title=Inside%20The%20Hubbards%20Backyard%20Nuptials" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-the-hubbards-backyard-nuptials.html&title=Inside%20The%20Hubbards%20Backyard%20Nuptials" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-hubbards-backyard-nuptials.html&title=Inside%20The%20Hubbards%20Backyard%20Nuptials" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-the-hubbards-backyard-nuptials.html&description=Inside%20The%20Hubbards%20Backyard%20Nuptials" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./662697f446163f25098b4583-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sant Jordi, la tradicin del dragn y la leyenda del caballero que no conoce todo el mundo">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./squalane-oil.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everything You Need to Know About Squalane Oil">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
