With the recent release of The Tortured Poets Department, dive into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn’s relationship timeline</a> below.</p><p>The Grammy-winner was first linked to the British actor in May 2017, although it’s rumored that the pair first met at the 2016 Met Gala a year prior. Over six years, the couple largely kept their relationship out of the public eye and went to great lengths to keep their romance under wraps from the media.</p><p>While speaking with Paul McCartney for their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone cover</a>, Swift opened up about how scary it was to fall in love with someone who has a “very grounded, normal way of living.” She explained, “I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives,” she said at the time. “I can’t control if there’s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow.”</p><p>The couple ultimately called it quits in April 2023 while Swift was on tour, giving fans a front-row seat to the singer as she publicly went through a breakup. Before the news of their split broke, Swift swapped the love song “Invisible String” for the breakup track “The 1.” A Swiftie also held up a sign asking if she was okay, to which the “Delicate” artist gave the concerned fan a thumbs up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-s-relationship-timeline>Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn’s relationship timeline</h2><p>Now, Swift is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>happily dating</a> Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce, and the couple have taken a more public approach to their romance.

At the 2016 Met Gala, she also met actor Tom Hiddleston, whom she had a brief fling with that summer after her breakup with the Scottish DJ.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.4711696869852><h2><strong>May 16, 2017: Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn are reportedly dating</strong></h2><p>In May 2017, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Sun</a> reported that 27-year-old Taylor Swift had been secretly dating the 26-year-old British actor for four months.

However, he said that he’d rather not discuss it. “I’m aware people want to know about that side of things,” the actor said. “I think we have been successfully very private and that has now sunk in for people … but I really prefer to talk about work.”</p><p>In another interview with Total Film, Alwyn provided more detail about why he wanted to keep their romance out of the public eye. “For me, I just don’t feel it’s something I want to offer up to be picked apart by people who don’t know about it, and it’s just not theirs to have,” he said, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.4218523878437><h2><strong>August 2019: Taylor Swift says her relationship with Joe Alwyn "isn't up for discussion"</strong></h2><p>Like Alwyn, Swift told <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian</a> in August 2019 that keeping her relationship with the British actor under wraps allows her to separate her personal and professional lives. “I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion,” the singer said. “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we’d be talking about it — but it’s just that it goes out into the world.”&nbsp;</p><p>She continued, “That’s where the boundary is, and that’s where my life has become manageable.

In the film, the singer spoke about why she fell in love with Alwyn after the Kanye West and Kim Kardashian drama. “I felt alone, I felt really bitter,” she explained. “I felt sort of like a wounded animal lashing out. I figured I had to reset everything. I had to reconstruct an entire belief system for my own personal sanity. I also was falling in love with someone who had a wonderfully normal, balanced life.”</p><p>Alwyn and Swift also shared a few sweet moments in Miss Americana. For example, we could see the pair cuddling at one of Swift’s concerts and the artist kissing his hand during a car ride.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.5><h2><strong>November 2020: Taylor Swift confirms Joe Alwyn was “William Bowery”</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/November-2020-Taylor-Swift-confirms-Joe-Alwyn-was-William-Bowery.png><p>During the pandemic, Swift released her eighth studio album, Folklore. Swift listed “William Bowery” as a collaborator on the record in an Instagram post, but Swifties quickly realized that no songwriter or producer was registered under that name. Therefore, it was speculated that “William Bowery” was a pen name for her boyfriend.</p><p>Swift finally confirmed that Alwyn was William Bowery while speaking about the album in Disney+’s Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions. “There’s been a lot of discussion about William Bowery and his identity, ’cause it’s not a real person,” the singer said in the film. “William Bowery is Joe, as we know.” Alwyn worked on two songs: “betty” and “exile.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.95092024539877><h2><strong>March 14, 2021: Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn win a Grammy Award for Folklore</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Taylor-Swift-winning-Album-of-the-Year-at-2021-Grammy-Awards.png><p>Taylor Swift took home her third Album of the Year Award at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards on March 14, 2021.
