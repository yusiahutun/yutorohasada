However, it was all a scam. Her parents believed that she was a straight-A student who and pushed her to do ice-skating and piano lessons. That was far from the truth when she was in high school, where she received C grades and lied about her extracurricular activities At the time, she hung out with her on-and-off again boyfriend Daniel Wong. She had her acceptance to Ryerson University rescinded and lied to her parents about volunteering at the blood-testing lab at SickKids hospital and studying at the more prestigious University of Toronto to study pharmacology—a dream of her father’s.</p><p>Her mother Bich Ha Pan and father Huei Hann found out about the lies after Hann followed his daughter and figured out that her routine didn’t match up with what she was telling him. Jennifer was banned from using her computer and cellphone after they confronted her, and they forbade her from seeing Daniel Wong. The two eventually broke up, but rekindled their relationship, when Wong proposed that they should hire a hit on her parents and have a hand in their $500,000 inheritance.</p><p>Wong introduced her to Lenford Crawford, who agreed to do the hit for $10,000. He and his associates David Mylvaganam and Eric Carty walked in through the unlocked front door of the family home and dragged Hann out of his bedroom where he was sleeping. The three ended up shooting Bich Ha in the head immediately killing her, while they shot Hann in the face. Jennifer Pan ended up calling the police claiming that intruders had came into her house and held her and her parents captive. Hann was in a medically induced coma for three days and survived.</p><p>In police interviews, Jennifer Pan recalled the scene, “He tied my arms back and said, ‘I have a gun behind your back. Do what I say. If you do what I say then no one will get hurt. Where’s the money? Show me where your money is.'” She explained: ‘I had a bit of money put aside from when I was waitressing – cash. So I showed him where it was and he took it and put it in his pocket I think.”</p><p>When Hann woke up from his coma, he immediately pointed to Jennifer Pan and accused her of orchestrating the scene and claimed that she fabricated the story of being captive as she was talking “calmly” to the suspects. After a third round of interrogation by the police, Jennifer Pan confessed in her involvement with the murders.</p><p>Hann wrote in his victim statement: “When I lost my wife, I lost my daughter at the same time. On the day Bich died, I feel I died too.”</p><p>He recalled he could no longer work and had been unable to return to the family home after the attack. He and his son Felix are currently under a no-contact clause with Jennifer Pan. I hope my daughter Jennifer thinks about what happened to her family and can become a good, honest person someday,’ he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jennifer-pan-book.jpg><p>The story of Jennifer Pan is one of all-consuming love and devious betrayal that led to a cold-hearted plan hatched by a group of youths who thought they could pull off the perfect crime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfn7KvusifnKtloJa7brrOsGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-pan-now.html&text=Where%27s%20Jennifer%20Pan%20Now%3f%20What%20Happened%20After%20Parent%27s%20Murder&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-pan-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-pan-now.html&title=Where%27s%20Jennifer%20Pan%20Now%3f%20What%20Happened%20After%20Parent%27s%20Murder" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjennifer-pan-now.html&title=Where%27s%20Jennifer%20Pan%20Now%3f%20What%20Happened%20After%20Parent%27s%20Murder" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-pan-now.html&title=Where%27s%20Jennifer%20Pan%20Now%3f%20What%20Happened%20After%20Parent%27s%20Murder" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-pan-now.html&description=Where%27s%20Jennifer%20Pan%20Now%3f%20What%20Happened%20After%20Parent%27s%20Murder" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nerize-peyper.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Nerize Peyper dating?
