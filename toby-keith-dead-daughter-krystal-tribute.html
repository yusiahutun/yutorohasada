I’m lucky I got to say goodbye and tell him what he meant to me."</p><p>She goes on to note the outpouring of tributes from fans, friends and peers that have come since Keith died after battling stomach cancer since late 2021, saying it's a reminder how important he was in the lives of so many others.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Toby Keith's Top&nbsp;20 Songs Prove He's a Country Icon</a></strong></p><p>"I will forever honor him," Krystal states.
