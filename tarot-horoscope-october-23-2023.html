Perhaps you’ve been working on a project or area of your life and haven’t yet reaped the rewards of your efforts. Understandably, this has been a source of frustration for you.

These kinds of struggles don’t just take a toll on your pocketbook; they can become emotional, mental, and spiritual burdens as well. Don’t shoulder the weight of the world by yourself.

The Page of Cups is urging you to go back to the time in your life when you were more childlike, more fearless, more idealistic. It could be that past or recent circumstances have made you more cynical and closed off as a way to shield yourself from getting hurt.
