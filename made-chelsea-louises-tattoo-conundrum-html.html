The whole situation has very much stressed her out so she takes to her bath tub to try and finalise the plans. She phones up Ryan and informs him she is currently bathing. ‘I do all my important phone calls from the bath,’ she says. ‘Are you naked?’ he asks. No, Ryan, she’s wearing plastic sheeting and moon boots.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Louise is FURIOUS that Ryan spoke to Sophie while she was languishing in bubbles. What’s more, Sophie’s asked him to carry her into her party on his naked shoulders. Louise allows it on the condition that Sophie’s skin doesn’t make contact in any way with Ryan. Presumably Sophie is meant to ride him using a saddle.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Frankie and James have their running date and they push each other about as they jog because that’s what you do on a running date. In typical MIC-style they dissect and analyse each other’s compatibility while on the actual date. ‘There’s some sort of chemistry – but I can’t work it out,’ James says. For Christ’s sake James, we’re not looking for you to calculate how many oxygen atoms are in a 2 litre bottle of water!</p><img id=i-c7ed35904952314 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/05/00/46FC26BA00000578-5145419-Absolutely_fuming_Beautiful_Louise_is_FURIOUS_that_Ryan_spoke_to-a-5_1512432060241.jpg height=355 width=634 alt="Absolutely fuming: Beautiful Louise is FURIOUS that Ryan spoke to Sophie while she was languishing in bubbles" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Absolutely fuming: Beautiful Louise is FURIOUS that Ryan spoke to Sophie while she was languishing in bubbles</p><img id=i-ddc074ce4fc27783 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/04/22/46FC26B200000578-5145419-image-a-61_1512426610166.jpg height=357 width=634 alt="A bubbling idea: What¿s more, Sophie¿s asked him to carry her into her party on his naked shoulders" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>A bubbling idea: What’s more, Sophie’s asked him to carry her into her party on his naked shoulders</p><img id=i-9ce4e6a3d63efcc5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/04/22/46FC26AA00000578-5145419-image-a-62_1512426619519.jpg height=352 width=634 alt="The cheek of it: Louise allows it on the condition that Sophie¿s skin doesn¿t make contact in any way with Ryan.
