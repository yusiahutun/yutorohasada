Despite being ill-suited to his new conditions (too much sunlight and periods of under and overwatering), Jeremy remained steadfast and refused to give up the ghost. Theresa’s development was slow, and – after a series of unfortunate, tragic domestic events (accidental waterboarding and eventual decapitation) – a replacement was necessary. Pleasingly, Theresa the second is going from strength to strength.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following the arduous journey of Jeremy and Theresa, I now have 12 house plants that decorate my kitchen, living room and bedroom. That doesn’t include the dried bunches of eucalyptus that are draped over my wardrobe, nor the fresh flowers I currently have in five small vases around my South London flat. My flatmate tells me our living space looks like a cross between Elton John’s house and Kew Gardens, a comment I have interpreted as a compliment. I have braved Colombia Road Flower Market in hail stones because I thought that I’d be in a strong position for a better plant-based bargain (I was right), and I cannot resist asking for botanical additions when it comes to birthdays and Christmases. I am a plant addict.</p><img alt="interior design for living area or reception with , rattan armchair,plants,cabinet on wood floor and concrete background / 3d illustration,3d rendering" title="interior design for living area or reception with , rattan armchair,plants,cabinet on wood floor and concrete background / 3d illustration,3d rendering" width=2200 height=1613 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1053955452.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My newfound obsession with botanicals is far from isolated.

A substantial evidence base already exists that demonstrates how exposure to green space is very good for us. Living and working in a greener environment is associated with better mental health and lower all-cause mortality, from conditions such as circulatory disease and asthma, while cutting obesity levels through encouraging physical activity. Healthier workers make more productive workers.”</p><img alt="Green, Houseplant, Tree, Furniture, Table, Couch, Plant, Living room, Room, House, " title="Green, Houseplant, Tree, Furniture, Table, Couch, Plant, Living room, Room, House, " width=1173 height=1600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/arborateum-1563535432.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Inside Arboretum</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Our raised awareness of body and mind has contributed to the popularity of indoor botanicals. The science goes that plants are adept at absorbing gases through their leaves and roots, thus cleaning the air for us. But the appeal goes beyond that - we also know that being outdoors, or at least around greenery, is good for us mentally. The proven psychological benefits include lower stress levels, increased worker productivity and an improved mood, while physical advantages span reduced blood pressure, improved breathing and reduced headaches and fatigue.

There’s a kind of therapy to be found in dealing with soil and growing things.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“While there has been a big focus on what we are putting into our bodies, there is now an increasing number of people considering what they are putting in their homes to make themselves feel better,” says Patch founder Freddie Blackett. “There’s an abundance of studies which point out the links between plants and feeling calmer, happier and more at ease. Plants are an instant fix for a more aesthetically pleasing home, but we constantly hear from new ‘plant parents’ saying how tending to their new bit of botany helps clear their head.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beth Chapman founded <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.leafenvy.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Leaf Envy" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Leaf Envy</a>, a digital company dedicated to ‘plant parenthood’, after moving to LA and choosing botanics as her key interior investment. She eventually returned to the UK to launch her business and sold out of all plants and pots during her first week of pre-orders. She also sells greenery from her barge on Regent’s Canal where she’s able to talk to customers about their plant problems. In August, she will launch a WhatsApp notification platform to help the green-fingered care for their plant once they’ve received it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Plant parenthood is a cathartic release from our always-on, tech-first and urban society,” says Chapman. “It’s a form of escapism from the modern world, and gives us that precious time we need to reconnect with nature.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While she agrees with the health benefits that plants offer, Chapman says that taking an interest in botanics isn’t news. “I don’t think it actually ever lost popularity,” she said. “My mum still talks about the cheese plant she had back in the '70s with fondness. I think it’s just that social media has meant more people are posting about plants and sharing their journey.”</p><img alt="Interior of bathroom - house plants" title="Interior of bathroom - house plants" width=3840 height=5760 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-960895086-1563536084.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Alice Vincent points out that we’ve been nurturing houseplants for centuries. “Victorian teenage girls were fascinated by ferns, for instance,” she says, referring to Victorian women using ferns as a way to express passion and desire (ferns were thought to look like female nether regions). “Humans instinctively react to green and living things. Much as people will jest about ‘plant babies’, I think most realise they are not the same as rearing a family. What I would say, though, is that houseplants are a great way of sprucing up a drab rented home; they offer a sense of permanence when so much in our generation’s lives are uncertain.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like so many modern trends, whether lifestyle or fashion, social media has played a role in the horticulture rise.

Following a plant-based Instagram account can give beginners and people new to horticulture dollops of inspiration and advice in a really accessible way. It’s democratised the scene massively.”</p><img alt="indoor plants" title="indoor plants" width=3840 height=3840 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/patch-1563536259.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Patch Plants</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A lot has been made about whether or not millennials are buying plants because they can’t afford their own homes. While many can’t afford to climb the first rung on the property ladder, they can stretch to invest in houseplants to personalise their home. It’s also no surprise that plants are most popular in urban spaces that lack natural greenery.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“My flat previously felt bare and dull and I was unsure how I could change it,” says plant owner Sam Green. “I was unable to paint the walls to reflect my personality, but by adding plants my living space was transformed to reflect my style and character.
