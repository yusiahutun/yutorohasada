Rocco, perhaps, met his then-future wife through mutual friends presumably in 2009 when the golf pro ironically happened to be seeing someone else.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/12/04/rocco-mediate-and-jessica-mediate-are-parents-to-a-daughter--1575455215.jpg width=450 height=676 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rocco Mediate and Jessica Mediate are parents to a daughter. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Rocco Mediate Twitter</span></strong><p>But, their past was just history and didn't matter when the love birds realized the person they wanted to be with for the rest of their life was meant to come to their life in their mid-age. Fast forward to 2013, Rocco asked Jessica to marry him, to which his then-girlfriend obviously couldn't say no to.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/12/04/rocco-mediate-and-jessica-mediate-in-hawaii-on-their-wedding--1575455074.jpg width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rocco Mediate and Jessica Mediate in Hawaii on their wedding. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Rocco Mediate Twitter</span></strong><p>And, by the next year, in 2014, Jessica became Mrs. Mediate after exchanging the marital vows with the Pennsylvania native in Hawaii where she looked decently gorgeous in a white dress.</p><h2>Mediate's Gambling & Drinking Habit Made His First Wife Leave Him</h2><p>Mr. Rocco previously shared a married life of more than twenty years with his first wife, <strong>Linda Newell</strong>, the mother of his three sons namely <strong>Rocco Mediate</strong>, <strong>Nicco Mediate</strong>, <strong>Marco Mediate</strong>. Sadly, as the worst got the best of Rocco, Rocco faced some of the worst nightmares.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/12/04/rocco-mediate-and-first-wife-linda-shares-three-sons-together--1575455007.jpg width=450 height=299 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rocco Mediate and first wife, Linda share three sons together. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Getty Images</span></strong><p>But, who else could the Florida native blame when it was his own gambling and drinking addiction that made Linda grow frustrated of it and leave him, eventually. Rocco, on the other hand, only got rid of his drinking habit he developed to cope with his career-ending back pain in 2017.</p><p>Things between the alum of Florida Southern College and Linda who now lives in Seattle with their boys are on better terms, though. The retailer who sells children's books mentioned in a book that she was sorry about all the pain and trauma the father of her kids had to go through.</p><p>Rocco and her estranged wife finalized their divorce in 2008. And, during the time, the father of four had already moved on and was actually seeing a new woman.</p><h2>Rocco's Short-Lived Affair With His Therapist</h2><p>Rocco met his then-new lover aka <strong>Cindy Hilfman</strong> in 2007 after the golfer suffered back pain and emotional trauma, and had already separated from Newell. Matter of fact, it was Hilfman herself who didn't only help Mediate recover fully but also became a friend who understood and supported him on the emotional level.</p><p>Hilfman, likewise, was married and had split from her husband <strong>Greg Hilfman</strong>, a musician, with whom she shared a son. But, Hilfman and Mediate's affair didn't become public until 2008 at the US Open Game where the absence of the golfer's former spouse and sons were highly noticed.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/12/04/rocco-and-linda-newell-finalized-their-divorce-in-2008--1575455321.jpg width=450 height=407 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rocco and Linda Newell finalized their divorce in 2008. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Daily Mail</span></strong><p>Although the couple's relationship didn't last long, the duo was strongly in love whilst it lasted. Not to mention, when the physical therapist had to undergo a serious liver transplant illness, Rocco was there to nurse her.</p><p>It was after the breakup with Hilfman, Rocco then met and fell in love with Jessica, with whom he has been together for over seven years today, as of 2019.</p><p>Stay tuned for more interesting Celebrity <a href=# rel=noopener>Gossips</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Biographies</a> on <a href=# rel=noopener>Marriedwiki.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyzu8KcpmallZm2osDEZqqhmaKawG6tjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzedaiq6Flo5qwsLrDZq6inpVit6a%2F0qKammWdmrGqrdOe</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frocco-mediate-shares-a-daughter-with-second-wife-jessica-mediate.html&text=Rocco%20Mediate%20Shares%20A%20Daughter%20With%20Second%20Wife%20Jessica%20Mediate&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frocco-mediate-shares-a-daughter-with-second-wife-jessica-mediate.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frocco-mediate-shares-a-daughter-with-second-wife-jessica-mediate.html&title=Rocco%20Mediate%20Shares%20A%20Daughter%20With%20Second%20Wife%20Jessica%20Mediate" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frocco-mediate-shares-a-daughter-with-second-wife-jessica-mediate.html&title=Rocco%20Mediate%20Shares%20A%20Daughter%20With%20Second%20Wife%20Jessica%20Mediate" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frocco-mediate-shares-a-daughter-with-second-wife-jessica-mediate.html&title=Rocco%20Mediate%20Shares%20A%20Daughter%20With%20Second%20Wife%20Jessica%20Mediate" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frocco-mediate-shares-a-daughter-with-second-wife-jessica-mediate.html&description=Rocco%20Mediate%20Shares%20A%20Daughter%20With%20Second%20Wife%20Jessica%20Mediate" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./shania-twain-inundated-love-support-emotional-message-pride-month.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shania Twain leaves fans emotional with heartfelt message marking Pride">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jade-global-the-world-of-technology.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jade Global-World of Technology-Karan Yaramada| The Enterprise World">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
