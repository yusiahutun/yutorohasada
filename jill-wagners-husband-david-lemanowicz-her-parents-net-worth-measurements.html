Some of the other television shows you’ll find her in include Bones, Teen Wolf, and even Dancing with the Stars. Besides television, Jill enjoyed a fruitful career as a model. Her career dates back to the early 2000s when she first moved to California.</p><p>It saw her grace magazines like Maxim and FHM. Wagner is married to a man named David Lemanowicz, who we will also focus on in the next paragraphs. We will also look at Jill’s parents and net worth.</p><h2><strong>Jill Wagner is married to David Lemanowicz.</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Wagner’s relationship</a> with her husband dates back to the 1996 Hockey season. David was an ice hockey player at the time, and Jill was just a fan. She was only 17 back then. The two saw each other a few more times before life eventually put them on different paths. Their paths intertwined a few decades later when they ran into each other in Afghanistan.</p><p>Jill Wagner and David Lemanowicz started dating and announced their engagement to the public in 2016. Before this, the couple had moved in together. They were living in a house in Tellico Plains with David’s older daughter. The very next year, Jill and David were walking down the aisle.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-997 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Jill-Wagner-husband-David.jpg alt="Image of Jill Wagner with her husband David Lemanowicz" width=600 height=636 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-997 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Caption: Jill Wagner with her husband David Lemanowicz</strong></p><p>They officially tied the knot on the 8th of April 2017 in what was a lovely ceremony. It was held at the Rose Hill Plantation in Nashville, North Carolina. They had close friends and family present. Two years after they were married, Jill Wagner and husband David Lemanowicz delighted the world by announcing that they were expecting their first child together.</p><h2><strong>Who is David Lemanowicz?</strong></h2><p>David Lemanowicz is a retired vet and former athlete who specialized in Ice Hockey. He was born on the 8th of March 1976 in Vancouver, British Columbia, which would make him 44 currently. David’s parents are two Polish natives who moved to Canada back in the 70s.</p><p>His educational background includes a stint at the University of Toronto, where he attained a degree in International Relations. While at the institution, he was heavily involved with the hockey team. After representing the college for two years, he went on to coach the team in his final two years at school as well!</p><p>After he hung up his skates, David’s next ambition was to join the US Army. To that end, Lemanowicz joined the Texas-Pan University through an ROTC sponsored program. His time at the college was highlighted with a degree in Global Security.</p><p>Jill Wagner’s husband David spent most of his life bouncing from place to place. He has lived in places like Poland, Vancouver, Texas, and even Washington. Being a part of the military, he has been on multiple tours across the world. As we mentioned before, he reunited with his 2nd wife while he was on active duty in the Middle East.</p><h2><strong>David Lemanowicz’s first wife and first marriage.</strong></h2><p>Long before he married Jill, David was involved with a woman named Gina. She is an American woman who relocated to Canada when she was just seven years old. The two first met while they were both college students at Toronto University. They went on to date for five years before finally opting to take their relationship to the next level.</p><p>David and Gina became husband and wife in 2005. They lived in Edinburg, along with their pets. David moved the family to America when he decided to join the military. His wife’s American citizenship made it much easier for him to be accepted into the Army.</p><p>The couple’s only daughter, Lija, was born in 2010. She is just ten years old at the moment. Two years after Lija’s birth, however, David and Gina got divorced.</p><h2><strong>David Lemanowicz’s net worth.</strong></h2><p>Lemanowicz made a good chunk of his wealth from his time playing hockey back in Canada. He was not only a prominent player but also a coach for a few years. Other than this, David also served in the military. According to our sources, senior sergeants can make as much as $40,000 a year.</p><p>This is not including some of the benefits which military personnel receive. Besides this, he also worked as a tour guide for a few years. Currently, David Lemanowicz’s net worth stands at $500,000.</p><h2><strong>Jill Wagner Net Worth.</strong></h2><p>Wagner has been a mainstay on television for several years. On the show ‘Wipeout,’ for instance, she appeared on 82 episodes throughout the show’s run. In total, she has about 32 various credited roles in both movies and television.</p><p>Her latest project came in 2020’s Mystery 101: An Education in Murder. Jill also enjoyed a lucrative career as a model. At the height of her career, she worked as a brand ambassador for famous companies such as Ford Motor Company. Presently, Jill Wagner’s net worth is $4 million.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-998 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Jill-Wagner-net-worth.jpg alt="Image of American film actress, Jill Wagner net worth" width=600 height=452 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-998 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Caption: American film actress, Jill Wagner net worth</strong></p><h2><strong>Meet Jill Wagner’s mother.</strong></h2><p>Jill’s mother was not exactly a parent who was heavily involved in her daughter’s life. As such, details about her are very scarce. We did uncover that Jill was raised by a father, David. Like her husband, Jill’s old man is also a former military man.</p><p>He was part of the US Marines. Growing up, another person who played a parental role in Jill’s life was her grandfather.</p><h2><strong>Children.</strong></h2><p>Jill’s daughter, Amy Gray, was born on April 17th, 2020. She is almost three months old at the moment. Wagner also has a 10-year old stepdaughter named Lija.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-999 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Jill-Wagner-kids.jpg alt="Image of Jill Wagner with her kids Amy Gray and Lija" width=600 height=748 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-999 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Caption: Jill Wagner with her kids Amy Gray and Lija</strong></p><h2><strong>Her age and DOB.</strong></h2><p>Jill Wagner was born on the 13th of January 1979 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. At the point of writing, she is 41-years old. Loyalty, discipline, and openness are some of the qualities associated with Capricorns like Wagner.</p><h2><strong>Her Measurements.</strong></h2><p>Being a model, we were not surprised to learn that Jill is fairly tall. She is 1.73 meters tall, which also equates to 5 feet 8 inches. Switching focus to her weight, we found that she weighs about 135 pounds. Other relevant measurements we found relate to her waist and hip ratio; 37-25-35 inches.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2BMnJylnZKntrW1xKxlnKedZLequMtmrpqfnpq%2FtHnHrqqbmZ6ZeqWt1aKbZqSVoq6vu9aimrNlmJq%2FbrzAq5ynrKNiu6bAjLCmq6yYYrqmrdKuqZ6llaPBtHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjill-wagners-husband-david-lemanowicz-her-parents-net-worth-measurements.html&text=Jill%20Wagners%20Husband%20David%20Lemanowicz%2c%20her%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Measurements.&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjill-wagners-husband-david-lemanowicz-her-parents-net-worth-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjill-wagners-husband-david-lemanowicz-her-parents-net-worth-measurements.html&title=Jill%20Wagners%20Husband%20David%20Lemanowicz%2c%20her%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Measurements." target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjill-wagners-husband-david-lemanowicz-her-parents-net-worth-measurements.html&title=Jill%20Wagners%20Husband%20David%20Lemanowicz%2c%20her%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Measurements." target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjill-wagners-husband-david-lemanowicz-her-parents-net-worth-measurements.html&title=Jill%20Wagners%20Husband%20David%20Lemanowicz%2c%20her%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Measurements." target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjill-wagners-husband-david-lemanowicz-her-parents-net-worth-measurements.html&description=Jill%20Wagners%20Husband%20David%20Lemanowicz%2c%20her%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Measurements." target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./528993-micky-gellers-death-what-happened-canadian-waterskier.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Micky Geller's death: What really happened to the Canadian waterskier?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./everyone-taylor-swift-alludes-to-in-the-tortured-poets-department.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everyone Taylor Swift Seemingly Alludes to in 'The Tortured Poets Department' And Why">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
