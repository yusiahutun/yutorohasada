At the time of his birth, his mum was a nurse, and his dad a preacher. He has three siblings and is the second youngest. In his foster years, Jean grew up in Harare, Zimbabwe, where he used to play in a band with one of his brothers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a94e67144349a2cb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who are rapper Logic's parents?

He has since lived there and established his acting finesse. Regé started acting as a hobby, but the National Youth Theatre changed his trajectory.</p><p class=align-left>Page found acting to be fun-filled and made up his mind to pursue the career professionally. He graduated from Drama Centre London in 2013.</p><h3>Is Regé-Jean Page black?</h3><p class=align-left>It is only fair to characterize him as a rare gem. Jean's charm and looks are to die for, and many fans keep asking, "what ethnicity is Regé Jean Page?" His black curly hair and dark complexion make people wonder about his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">exact roots</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Well, he is a British-Zimbabwean. He was born out of mixed-race parents, an aspect that he appreciates. While speaking to a few news outlets, including The Interview Magazine, Page stated;</p>Just by walking around with my face, my parents did a fairly revolutionary thing that pi**es off some of you. As a mixed-race child, you have to think about crafting your own identity. You even question why you belong in the world.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7067527ddde1e676.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Chris Isaak's wife?

Frankly, his acting roles have been spontaneous, with his impact in the acting <a href=#>world</a> felt almost every year. Below is a list of Regé-Jean Page movies since he started his acting profession:</p><ul><li>2015 - Waterloo Road</li><li>2016 - Roots</li><li>2016 - ABC pilot Spark</li><li>2017 - For the People</li><li>2018 - Mortal Engines</li><li>2020 - Sylvie’s Love</li><li>2020 - Bridgerton</li></ul><p class=align-left>In February 2021, The <i>Hollywood Reporter</i> revealed that Page had signed a partnership as a leading role in Paramount's Dungeons & Dragons feature. He will feature alongside sizzling casts such as Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, and Justice Smith."</p><h3>Who is Regé-Jean Page wife?</h3><p class=align-left>Considering Simon Basset's great looks, it's no wonder his fans are itching to unravel Regé-Jean Page<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> partner</a>. The 31-year-old actor keeps his personal life under wraps. He was, however, spotted with the gorgeous Emily Brown, an author and <a href=#>football</a> player. Allegations of a romantic relationship begun circulating.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/95e8aecf5d994a1c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Danny Masterson net worth 2021: How rich is That '70s Show</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nonetheless, none of the parties has addressed the rumours of an intimate relationship. Likewise, some followers tend to query Jean’s affair with fellow <i>Bridgerton</i> cast Phoebe Dynevor off-screen.</p><p class=align-left>This could probably be based on the chemistry and love language that the duo portrays in the series. But, Page has addressed the assumption claiming that everything that people want to know is on-screen. His response was quite vague, living people with more questions than answers.</p><h3>Regé-Jean Page net worth information</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7067527ddde1e676.jpg><p class=align-left>There is no stopping Page.
