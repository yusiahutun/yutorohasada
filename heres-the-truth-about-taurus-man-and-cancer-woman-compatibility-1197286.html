Because these star signs are two positions apart on the zodiac charts, their relationship is strong and they have a powerful emotional connection from the beginning. Taurus is controlled by Venus, the goddess of love, and Cancer is emotional and sensitive and responds to this love. Domesticated and prone to cuddling each other adorably, both signs prefer spending time together at home.</p><p>Do you want to date a male Taurus and are yourself a Cancer woman?

She will then be able to provide him with the love and care he so desperately needs.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Taurus men enjoy being treated like lords, and the Cancer woman excels in providing such treatment.

Without any communication, they somehow have the intuition to know what the other needs. This is why so many of them end up becoming best friends.</p><p><strong>Intimacy</strong></p><p>You may anticipate a positively explosive bedroom experience because these two can easily converse with one another and make things happen magically. These two are so in sync that they don't even need to speak to each other to understand what the other needs. He will innately understand her requirements, and she will be able to tell what he would find enjoyable. This consistently results in them having enjoyable interactions with each other.

If they don't get along, their moon or ascendant sign is probably at fault. Then you need to investigate what those are and the reason why they don't add up. The important thing to remember is that whatever problems these two may have, they can probably resolve them. However, everyone can have baggage that they find difficult to shed. Keep in mind that Cancer can withdraw into their shell and Taurus can harbour grudges.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is feasible for the two of them to reconnect or find a solution if they have these kinds of issues.
