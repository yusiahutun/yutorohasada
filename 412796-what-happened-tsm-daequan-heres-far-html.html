Whether consciously or subconsciously, he has positioned himself among best in <i>Fortnite</i> thanks to his behaviour. He is also knowledgeable and skilled in the game.</p><p class=align-left>His ability to score hits and play well earned him an incredible following. Unfortunately, his frequent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">health and personal issues</a> caused multiple absences, which stalled his <i>Fortnite</i> career.</p><h3>Did Daequan quit Fortnite?</h3><p class=align-left>Hamlinz and Daequan never officially left <i>Fortnite.</i> However, their extremely long disappearance was disappointing to the entire community.
