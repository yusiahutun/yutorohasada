It would be harder for individuals with a personality that requires justification for what they are doing as they don't want to do the wrong thing.</p><p class=align-left>You cannot make everybody happy, and you need to put your happiness above all others. Also, it would be best if you remembered that not everyone is happy for you. Quotes, <a href=#>messages</a> and memes can be a great way of learning about this.</p><ul><li>Don't feel bad for making decisions that upset other people. You're not responsible for their happiness; you're responsible for yours.</li><li>I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it's like to feel worthless, and they don't want anyone else to feel like that.</li><li>I will leave and isolate myself rather than go through the futile task of trying to make everyone happy, which is impossible anyway. - Author: Donna Lynn Hope</li><li>Trying to please everyone is a recipe for stress, misery, and frustration. Be yourself. It'll be good to know who's down with that.</li><li>Why should I? The only enjoyment I have in my life is knowing I pi*s off everyone around me. If I were dead, it would make them all happy. God forbid I should ever do that. (Zarek) - Author: Sherrilyn Kenyon</li><li>You can't make everyone happy right away. You can't figure out what people want you to do. So, you have to do what you want to do and hope it works out.</li><li>It is not selfish to be happy. It is your highest purpose. Your joy is the most outstanding contribution you can make to living on the planet. A heart at peace with its owner blesses everyone it touches. - Author: Alan Cohen</li><li>You can't make everyone happy right away; you can't figure out what people want you to do; you have to do it and hope it works out.</li><li>You cannot live to please everyone else. You have to enlighten, educate and fulfil your dreams and destiny, and hope that whatever your art is that you're putting out there if it's received.</li><li>You need to understand that the people in this room make decisions that affect trillions of people every day. They are captains of industry and leaders of worlds. They need to be sharp, alert, relaxed and focused, or everyone suffers. So, all of this opulence you turn your nose at serves an authentic purpose. Keeping the elite happy benefits everyone. It is for the common good.</li><li>Bad food is made without pride by cooks who have no pride and love. Bad food is made by indifferent chefs who are trying to be everything to everybody, who are trying to please everyone... Therefore, lousy food is fake food... food that shows fear and lack of confidence in people's ability to discern or to make decisions about their lives.</li><li>I've learned that you have to make careful choices because everything has an impact. I've also known that you can't please everyone in life, so please yourself and determine what matters.</li><li>You can't please everyone, and you have to trust your instincts, and you have to do your work and throw yourself in there and trust your instincts, and trust that you're doing a good job that I can be proud of.</li><li>When I do a festival, I want everyone to have a party; I think it is similar to a club where everyone is there to have a good time and celebrate, not being at work or just having fun. I love people dancing to my music; if I can make them dance, I feel happy. - Author: Katy B</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9220fd22f42009c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ powerful quotes that hit hard because they are deep and true</span></p></a><h2>Meaningful people-pleasing quotes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/429ae68ccaf13dad.jpg><p class=align-left>Are you a people pleaser?

It doesn’t have to be sought; it’s given to you.</li><li>If you’re trying to please everyone, then you’re not going to make anything that is honestly yours, in the long run.</li><li>We've become conditioned to compromise and shrink ourselves to be liked. But unfortunately, when you work so hard to get everyone to like you, you often do not like yourself so much.</li><li>There is only one way to avoid criticism: do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing.</li><li>I surrendered myself to the cages of others' expectations, cultural mandates and institutional allegiances. Until I buried who I was to become what I should be. I lost myself when I learned how to please.</li><li>I want you to look inside the next time you say yes to something. Do you wish you didn't say yes? How does it feel? You are not a bad friend if you give them fast notice that you cannot help them. Call them right away to tell them you have a schedule conflict.</li><li>Because one believes in oneself, one doesn't try to convince others. Because one is content with oneself, one doesn't need others' approval. Because one accepts oneself, the whole world accepts them.</li><li>When I stopped feeling sorry for myself, I realized that my decision was motivated by my necessity to please everyone except myself. There had never been a time where I stood up against my family. And this was out of my desperate need to be accepted.</li><li>To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.</li><li>Your need for acceptance can make you invisible in this world. Don't let anything stand in the way of the light that shines through this form. Risk being seen in all of your glory.</li><li>You have brains in your head; you have feet in your shoes; you can steer yourself in any direction. But you're on your own, and you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go...</li><li>Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim.
