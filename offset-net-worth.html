Born Kiari Kendrell Cephus in 1991, he’s a Georgian native from the Atlanta suburb of Lawrenceville. He initially began as a backup dancer, performing in Whitney Houston’s 2002 music video for the song “Watchulookinat” when he was just 11 years old.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>The Formation And Rise Of Migos</h2><p><span>Six years later Offset formed a group with longtime friends Quavo and Quavo’s nephew, Takeoff, who also lived in Lawrenceville with Offset. The original group was named The Polo Club and cited several Down South artists such as Outkast, Lil Wayne, Master P. and, Gucci Mane as inspirations. They eventually renamed the group Migos as a play on the phrase “Three Amigos” since the members grew up together.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 2011 they released their first mixtape, “Jung Season,” but it was not until their single “Versace” gathered traction in 2013 that the group started to get more recognition. In 2015 the group released their debut studio album “Yung Rich Nation,” with the single “Bad and Boujee” going viral — especially after </span><a href=#><span>Donald Glover promoted the track</span></a><span> at the 2017 Golden Globes award during his acceptance speech for “Atlanta.” Offset was one of the primary features on “Bad and Boujee,” which helped to reinforce his expertise as an MC.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Subsequent albums saw higher success with the group’s second studio album “Culture” debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. This was followed by “Culture II” that was also released later in 2017. However, because of COVID-19, the follow up album “Culture III” was not released until June 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Migos’ Awards</h3><p><span>Although brief, Migos had a strong influence on music and as a result, received plenty of awards for their contributions to hip-hop music. The group garnered their first BET Hip Hop Award for the Best Mixtape thanks to “No Label II” before winning the Best Group award at the BET Awards in 2015.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 2017, the song “Bad and Boujee” dominated the awards circuit, earning the Top Rap Collaboration from the Billboard Music Awards and Best Group from the BET Awards. From both the BET Awards and MTV Video Music Awards in 2017, Migos won Best Collaboration, Video of the Year, Viewers Choice Award and the Best Hip Hop Video Awards. Meanwhile in 2018 Migos picked up awards from the iHeartRadio Music Awards, BET Awards and American Music Awards.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Migos Disbands</h3><p><span>Unfortunately, in November 2022 Takeoff was shot and killed in Houston. Fellow bandmate and uncle to Takeoff, Quavo, released the music video for “Greatness” several months later in February 2023 as a dedication to his nephew. Most people interpreted it as a sign that Migos had broken up and this was later confirmed in October when Offset was interviewed by popular New York radio station, Hot 97.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Offset Enjoys Solo Success</h2><p><span>Every member of Migos has released solo albums, with Offset being the last in the group to do so. But prior to his official solo album, “Father of 4,” which dropped in 2019, he was featured on several songs with other artists and even created a collaborative studio album with rapper 21 Savage titled “Without Warning.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 2017, he was featured on Metro Boomin’s song “No Complaints” with Drake and then later appeared on Macklemore’s song “Willy Wonka” in the same year. On “Father of 4” Offset performed the track “Clout” with Cardi B and then contributed the song “Hit Em Hard” for the “Fast & Furious 9” soundtrack. In 2023 he released his second studio album, “Set it Off.”</span></p><h3>Offset As An Actor</h3><p><span>While Offset’s primary credits are all related to the music industry — rapper, singer, and songwriter — he also has a few technical acting credits. In 2016, he appeared alongside his Migos bandmates in the “Go for Broke” episode in the first season of the FX series, “Atlanta.” He later appeared in an episode of “NCIS: Los Angeles” in 2020 and also was one of the anonymous singers only known as “Cupcake” in the popular reality performance show “The&nbsp; Masked Singer.”</span></p><h2>Offset’s Current Net Worth</h2><p><span>According to <a href=#>industry reports</a>, Offset’s current net worth sits somewhere between $26 and $28 million. Estimates suggest that in just one year alone between September 2017 and 2018, Migos earned a combined $25 million with the members taking a roughly even third cut — making Offset’s individual earnings around $8 million. This figure is thanks to the group’s intense show schedule which included a whopping 93 shows in 12 months. Meanwhile, they did earn significant revenue from streaming with earnings between September 2018 and September 2019 placed at $36 million.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Along with his musical earnings, the rapper also serves as a <a href=# rel=noopener>spokesperson</a> for several fashion designers and brands such a Lavati, Gosha Rubchinskiy and Bryce Barnes. He also hosts a show on Quibi titled “SKRRT with Offset” where he drives in expensive cars with other celebrities while conducting an interview with them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Offset is also an <a href=# rel=noopener>investor</a> in the Esports organization FaZe Clan. He owns a 22,000 square-foot home just outside of Atlanta with his wife, Cardi B. Although the couple paid $5.5 million for it in 2019, it was previously listed for $10 million in 2017.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlqe8tbHCoWWcp51kvKey0p6rZqaVqXq4u9Gtnw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2foffset-net-worth.html&text=What%20Is%20Offset%27s%20Reported%20Net%20Worth%20In%202024%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foffset-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2foffset-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Offset%27s%20Reported%20Net%20Worth%20In%202024%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2foffset-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Offset%27s%20Reported%20Net%20Worth%20In%202024%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2foffset-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Offset%27s%20Reported%20Net%20Worth%20In%202024%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foffset-net-worth.html&description=What%20Is%20Offset%27s%20Reported%20Net%20Worth%20In%202024%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./christmas-family-photo-ideas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="40 Best Christmas Family Photo Ideas for Your 2023 Cards">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jurassic-park-star-sam-neill-sells-double-bay-home-3-6million-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jurassic Park star Sam Neill sells his Double Bay home for more than $3.6million">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
