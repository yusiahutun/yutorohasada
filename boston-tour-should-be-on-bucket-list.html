On the other hand, driving downtown is another game altogether. Why? Because Boston has a very old-fashioned road layout and insufficient parking options.</p><p>On the other hand, MBTA, Boston’s public transport system, is nifty and inexpensive to explore the city. You can witness Cambridge, nearby suburbs, and many more unmissable attractions on your Boston tour.</p><p>Interestingly, walking through Boston could help you get a closer look at the city, without spending much time. Walking for an hour or so, you could explore plenty of charming places. The places include Charles River Esplanade or Cambridge, where you will be treated to a mesmerizing view of the city skyline.</p><p>If none of that works for you, there’s always a taxi. Boston’s taxis are generally available and easy to flag down. This is an ideal option if you’re planning to travel after the operational hours of MBTA.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cost of Living in Boston</h2><p>In contrast to its compact size, a Boston tour takes quite a big chunk out of your pocket. While planning your Boston visit, make sure to talk to city realtors for the best accommodation deals around the city.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, if budget is not an issue for you, Boston’s quality of life will leave you ecstatic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Culture-in-Boston-The-Enterprise-World.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When should you plan a Boston Tour?</h2><p>Boston weather is a mixed bag. To make the most out of your visit, make sure you plan your Boston trip between the months of June and October. Why? Because the summer during this time is mild, with temperatures anywhere between 15 to 28 degrees celsius. If you’re someone who is planning outdoor activities, then this is your time to shine.</p><p>The number of tourist visits drops significantly between March and May, and rightfully so. The Boston climate during these months is very dry and cold.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rich, Vibrant, yet Unique</h2><p>Boston is a city with a rich history, vibrant culture, and unique character. From its role in the American Revolution to its modern-day status as a center for innovation and intellectual activity, a Boston tour has much to offer for visitors and residents alike. Whether you’re exploring the city’s numerous museums and cultural institutions, cheering on the local sports teams, or indulging in the diverse culinary scene, you will never run out of things to do in Boston. If you’re planning a trip to the United States, be sure to put Boston tour on your list- you won’t be disappointed!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZK%2Bwv9OopWasn6q%2Fbr%2FHqKylnF2Xsm67zWaZrpubmsFuuMisqw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fboston-tour-should-be-on-bucket-list.html&text=Why%20a%20Boston%20Tour%20Should%20Be%20On%20Your%20Summer%20Bucket%20List%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fboston-tour-should-be-on-bucket-list.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fboston-tour-should-be-on-bucket-list.html&title=Why%20a%20Boston%20Tour%20Should%20Be%20On%20Your%20Summer%20Bucket%20List%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fboston-tour-should-be-on-bucket-list.html&title=Why%20a%20Boston%20Tour%20Should%20Be%20On%20Your%20Summer%20Bucket%20List%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fboston-tour-should-be-on-bucket-list.html&title=Why%20a%20Boston%20Tour%20Should%20Be%20On%20Your%20Summer%20Bucket%20List%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fboston-tour-should-be-on-bucket-list.html&description=Why%20a%20Boston%20Tour%20Should%20Be%20On%20Your%20Summer%20Bucket%20List%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hare-vs-rabbit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hare VS Rabbit: Whats The Difference?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./serena-williams-coach-boyfriend-patrick-mouratoglou-cosy-series-selfies-perth-airport-ahead-hopman-cup-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Serena Williams and coach boyfriend Patrick Mouratoglou cosy up for a selfies at Perth airport">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
