At some point, he allegedly got out of bed, loaded a rifle and shot son Hunter twice. Though his stepdaughter was watching TV in another room during the nap, authorities say she "witnessed the shooting."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b9d0e147-b164-4149-b2c9-af1ac993280a data-container-ref=toofab:article:4864db8a-e279-47cf-bc9d-013e99400a62 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ab/5by4/2023/06/19/abcacdf4e922436eb6c0d9e7fc650643_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Clermont County Sheriff’s Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Chilling Bodycam Video Shows Arrest of Father Charged with Lining Up and Killing 3 Sons Aged 3, 4 and 7</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to the report, the boys' sister saw Doerman chase after one of the children who made a run for it toward a nearby field -- Clayton, 7 -- shooting him and causing him to fall to the ground. Doerman then allegedly shot the child in the head, "at close range."</p><p>As this happened, the young girl is said to have ran back inside the home and picked up the youngest boy, Chase, before she "attempted to flee the residence with him." Doerman, however, allegedly caught up to her, held her at gunpoint and "demanded" she put down the child, which she did as she "begged" him not to shoot her. Doerman allegedly shot at Chase, but his gun didn't fire, so the child ran to his mother. The sister, meanwhile, ran to the fire department and <a href=#><strong>told witnesses her father was "killing everyone."</strong></a></p><p>The two parents then got into a "physical altercation," with Doerman reportedly "going so far as to bite" his wife to get her to drop Chase, per investigators. During the altercation, she is said to have placed her thumb over the barrel of the gun and was shot, causing her to drop the child. Doerman is accused of then fatally shooting the third son, before laying all three boys in the same area on the side of the home.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8e6c0854-cf7a-4409-ab63-24b0456c238b data-container-ref=toofab:article:4864db8a-e279-47cf-bc9d-013e99400a62 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/64/5by4/2023/06/22/6471d607e55446da9391789c3e258db1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Clermont County Sheriff’s Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Frantic 911 Calls Released Over Ohio Father Charged with Killing Three Sons Aged 3, 4 and 7</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to the docs, he then "sat on the side stoop of the residence and calmly watched [the wife] undertake futile live-saving measures on her three children," who all died from their injuries.</p><p>The docs also claim Doerman told authorities, "I did it. Take me to jail" and said "I shouldn't have done that." They also claim he "admitted to having been thinking about shooting his sons since October" and indicated "that the thoughts of having to kill his sons was so heavy on him that he hadn't slept for three or four days prior" to the murders.</p><p>Doerman of Monroe Township, Ohio was arrested on Thursday, June 15 after police responded to a number of 911 calls to his home. One of them, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>according to the Clermont County Sheriff’s Office</strong></a>, was from a woman screaming that "her babies had been shot."</p><p>Previously, <a href=#><strong>bodycam footage was released</strong></a> from the Clermont County Sheriff's Office which showed authorities arriving at the home -- proceeding with caution knowing the suspect had a rifle on him. In the video, Doerman can be seen sitting on the front stoop of the home with the gun beside him, before being thrown to the ground and handcuffed.</p><p>"Man, I ain't trying to hurt nobody. I'm completely sober. Never done drugs in my life," he said to authorities, before admitting that he had done drugs when he was younger but was "sober" now. "I'm not trying to hurt you," he told the deputies, before yelling at the family dog to go inside.</p><p>In the background, the children's mother can be heard screaming, "They're dead, aren't they? What do I do?" She then wailed, "He took my life from me, my life! They're so little!"</p><p>Doerman is being held without bail. So far, no motive has been revealed.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:db654ac6-545b-4fd9-b892-7c190d882b59 data-container-ref=toofab:article:4864db8a-e279-47cf-bc9d-013e99400a62 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/05/5by4/2023/06/30/05a216624ae548cb8855124944786b97_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Law&Crime</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">New Bodycam Footage Shows Behavior of Father Arrested for Killing Three Sons Just After Arrest</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bmam9fmLWisIydpp6qnZa7brnUq5ueql2ZsrWtyKWqZpufqr%2B1ecOomqxn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchad-doerman-murder-details-court-docs.html&text=New%20Docs%20Detail%20How%20Dad%20Allegedly%20Executed%20Three%20Sons%20Amid%20Wife%20%26amp%3b%20Daughter%27s%20Attempts%20To%20Stop%20Him&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchad-doerman-murder-details-court-docs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchad-doerman-murder-details-court-docs.html&title=New%20Docs%20Detail%20How%20Dad%20Allegedly%20Executed%20Three%20Sons%20Amid%20Wife%20%26amp%3b%20Daughter%27s%20Attempts%20To%20Stop%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchad-doerman-murder-details-court-docs.html&title=New%20Docs%20Detail%20How%20Dad%20Allegedly%20Executed%20Three%20Sons%20Amid%20Wife%20%26amp%3b%20Daughter%27s%20Attempts%20To%20Stop%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchad-doerman-murder-details-court-docs.html&title=New%20Docs%20Detail%20How%20Dad%20Allegedly%20Executed%20Three%20Sons%20Amid%20Wife%20%26amp%3b%20Daughter%27s%20Attempts%20To%20Stop%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchad-doerman-murder-details-court-docs.html&description=New%20Docs%20Detail%20How%20Dad%20Allegedly%20Executed%20Three%20Sons%20Amid%20Wife%20%26amp%3b%20Daughter%27s%20Attempts%20To%20Stop%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./book-summary-thinking-101-how-reason-better-live-better.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Summary: Thinking 101: How to Reason Better to Live Better by Woo-Kyoung Ahn">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./429491-kim-kardashian-discloses-daughter-north-criticises-her-house-upset-your-house-is-ugly-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Kardashian Says Daughter North Criticises Her House when Upset: &amp;quot;Your House Is Ugly&amp;quot;">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
