It makes one wonder, “What else don’t we know?” The Vikings, who lived in Scandinavia from the 8th to 11th centuries, are one of the most fascinating and studied groups renowned for their impressive skills in sailing and trading. Despite the numerous manuscripts and historical recordings depicting their culture and lifestyle, some questions remain. For instance, “Were there black Vikings?". Indeed, it is a question that needs an in-depth review of these ancient people.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1c283e8bf1b7cd51.png><h2 class=table-of-contents__title>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h2><p class=align-left>You've probably watched movies and television <a href=#>series</a> depicting the lifestyle of the Vikings, and yes, there exists differently-complexioned people in those films. This fact adds more vigour to the ideology of the existence of black Vikings.</p><p class=align-left>So, the question: "Is there any proof of black Vikings?" requires a different approach. And the answer lies in history books and historians' findings.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5de58e3df6186d25.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>From edge of extinction to Australia's croc 'paradise'</span></p></a><h2 id=539743-who-were-the-vikings class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Who were the Vikings?</h2><p class=align-left>Did you know that the Vikings were not a race? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to History</a>, from around A.D. 800 to the 11th century, numerous Scandinavians left their homes to seek fortune elsewhere. These people came from the regions now known as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, although there are some historical records of Finnish, Estonian, and Saami Vikings.</p><p class=align-left>These people are the ones who are collectively referred to as Vikings or Norsemen (Northmen). Their explorations outside their homeland led them to different territories, more so coastal sites where they raided undefended monasteries in the British Isles.</p><p class=align-left>So, what made the Vikings noticeable and unique? During that time, they attacked different places along the coastline; they were considered uncivilised, and the fact they came from a foreign land made them even harder to understand by the locals. Also, they were not Christian.</p><p class=align-left>Over the years, the Vikings would leave their mark as pirates, raiders, traders and settlers in Britain and Europe. They also made a mark in modern-day Russia, Iceland, Greenland and Newfoundland sections.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a4e875e592f01648.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The social structure of Mesopotamia: Classes, hierarchy, and organisation</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although the primary reason for exploring outside their home has not been discovered, the early ones sought riches.

However, this is more about <a href=#>entertainment</a> than historical accuracy.</p><p class=align-left>For centuries, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dark-skinned individuals </a>travelled to Scandinavia or were taken there as enslaved people. Therefore, it is automatic that they assimilated into the population over the years through farming, marriage, combat and other cultural factors.</p><p class=align-left>In his book, <i>A History of the Vikings</i>, Gwyn Jones provides evidence that there were individuals with different racial profiles among the Scandinavian people. He states that the ideology that the Vikings were a completely white race of people is factually false, and there were minority races who had brown skin tones as well.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/357baea9f28fb2cf.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Historic built environment in Kenya: 20 famous sites and monuments</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For instance, Harald Fairhair, Norway’s first king’s father, was Halfdan the Black (svarti), and two of his sons were also Halfdan, one named the White (hviti) and the other, interestingly, the Black.

The results of the DNA research were published in an article in the Nature <a href=#>Science</a> Journal.</p><p class=align-left>And it is evident from the findings that the Vikings were racially diverse. Even though the results didn't exclusively point out the existence of a black race, they showed that some people had both Sami and European heritage.

However, there have been stories of Vikings who hail from Africa. For instance, there is a 10th-century Viking called “Blacman” that manuscripts depict as having a <a href=#>dark complexion</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Still, it is unclear whether his “dark complexion” was because of race or was merely from getting tanned from spending too much time in the sun.</p><p class=align-left>There is also the story of legendary Norse explorer Leif Erikson, rumoured to have had an African mother.</p><h2 id=539743-did-vikings-reach-africa class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Did Vikings reach Africa?</h2><p class=align-left>There is no doubt that the Vikings explored distant lands in pursuit of wealth and colonisation, but did they <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reach Africa</a>?
