So the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Farmer Wants A Wife couples still together</a> might pleasantly surprise you. The hit reality dating show first debuted in the UK in 2001.</p><p>The premise is that farmers—<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who find it difficult to find spouses</a> because of their isolating professions—are introduced to women from the city as potential life partners. “In a trend that’s been sweeping America over the last few years, there’s been a migration from city centers to suburban and rural locales, and with that, love follows,” a press release from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>FOX reads</a>.</p><p>In the Canadian version of&nbsp;Farmer Wants a Wife&nbsp;(known as&nbsp;Farming For Love) developed by Fremantle Media, five Canadian farmers searching for love must open their hearts to a group of urban singles. As they date, the city contestants must adjust to the rural lifestyle and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">engage in challenges</a>, group activities, and one-on-one dates. Ultimately, the farmers choose who they want to pursue a relationship with at the end of the series.</p><p>Farmer Wants a Wife&nbsp;has been broadcast in Australia since 2007. The first eight seasons, until 2016, were hosted by Sam McClymont and broadcast on the Nine Network. The series was dropped by Nine and picked up by the Seven Network in 2015 and the show was revived for seasons nine, 10, 11, and 12. The show was renewed in October 2022 for a 13th, which aired in 2023.</p><p>Season 2 of the US version premiered on February 1, 2024, so naturally, we wondered about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Farmer Wants A Wife couples still together</a> across the major international franchises as well as at home. Spoiler alert: None of the US couples from season 1 are still together. But here’s who is across Canada and Australia.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=farmer-wants-a-wife-couples-still-together>Farmer Wants A Wife couples still together</h2><p>Without further ado…</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Ashleigh & Drew</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ashley-drew-farming-for-love.png><p>Status: Still together.</p><p>Farmer Ashleigh and her chosen partner Drew from Canada’s Farming For Love season 1 are still going strong and managing their properties in Gibsons, British Columbia.
