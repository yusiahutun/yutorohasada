In 2001, author Robert Greene released his second book “<a href=#>The Art of Seduction</a>.” The book was an international bestseller, fascinating readers with Greene’s examination of social power through seduction. In his book, Greene pointed out that seduction is more of a game of psychology than beauty, and that anyone can become adept at it. In the book, Greene noted that there are nine different types of seducers.</p><p>Whether you have read the book or not, it is interesting to think about which type of seducer you might be. So, without further ado, let’s take a look at these nine types and some examples of each one:</p><p class="ez-toc-title ez-toc-toggle">Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Siren></span><b>The Siren</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Sirens are able to seduce others by their beauty and ability to inspire fantasy. They often possess a certain sexual energy to them and they strive to only show others their positive characteristics. For example, Marilyn Monroe was a classic siren due to her ability to inspire a sense of masculinity in men.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Rake></span><b>The Rake</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Rakes have a way of figuratively stirring the pot and making us feel good about ourselves. When life seems rather humdrum, a rake will come along and rile things up a bit. The rake is especially adept with language and will use words to seduce another person. When rakes find someone that they want, they will make it clear that they will do anything to win you over.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Ideal_Lover></span><b>The Ideal Lover</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This type of seducer is very good at knowing what another person wants and seeing how much potential you have. They will take the time to really get to know you, asking questions to learn more about what makes you tick, and they will be quite empathetic. They represent a perfect vision of love, like a knight in shining armor in children’s books. If you tell an Ideal Lover what you want, he or she will do their best to create it for you.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Dandy></span><b>The Dandy</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Dandy is able to seduce men with masculine traits and attract women with feminine traits. They are completely free of gender roles and norms and can be ambiguous and wonderfully free of labels. People will often fall for the Dandy because of their effortless ability to <a href=#>question traditional values</a>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Natural></span><b>The Natural</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>If you feel you are a kid trapped in an adult’s body or you know someone who is, this is a classic description of a Natural. They have fun no matter what they are doing and are playful like a young child. People who miss the carefree days of their youth will often be attracted to the Natural, since they can help inspire these feelings in us. The Natural is also very sincere and can make others feel at ease right away.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Coquette></span><b>The Coquette</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Coquette is a French word meaning a flirtatious woman. This pretty much sums up how a Coquette will seduce others. There will be some teasing and sensuality, but then he or she will pull back and be mysterious. You may feel like you are just getting to know a Coquette when suddenly your texts are not answered for days at a time. They can be loyal at times but overall they are not very reliable as a partner.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Charmer></span><b>The Charmer</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When it comes to seduction, the Charmer has it down pat. They will feed your ego by telling you how brilliantly wonderful you are while praising you and validating everything you do. When you meet someone for the first time and walk away feeling like you are really awesome (which, of course, you are), you have probably just come face to face with a Charmer. Granted, there may be some <a href=#>manipulation</a> at play here with this type of seducer and there are times they may truly seem too good to be true.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Charismatic></span><b>The Charismatic</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>If you have ever been in a room filled with people yet all of the attention and energy seems to go to one person, he or she is probably a Charismatic. They are brimming with self-confidence and are extremely content with themselves. If you ever wondered who has a closet full of <a href=#>sexy Halloween costumes</a> at the ready-for-fun encounters with their partners, it is a Charismatic. They will have no problem dressing up as a superhero or space hero and enjoying a passionate evening with their love.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Star></span><b>The Star</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This type of seducer will stand out from the ordinary. They possess a magical and almost mythical specialness to them that makes them seem out of our league—which is exactly why they are so attractive. Many musicians, actors and famous authors are in this category. And while they may seem larger than life, they have a down-to-earth quality that allows them to relate to others.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=So%E2%80%A6Which_One_are_You></span><b>So…Which One are You?</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The idea that seducers fall into one of nine categories is intriguing. As you read through these descriptions, maybe you saw shades of yourself in one and your partner in another. So are you a Rake, a Natural, a Siren or maybe a Coquette? See if you can decide and then ask your friends what they think—it may lead to some interesting discussions!</p><p>Read more <a href=#>lifestyle and relationship articles</a> at <a href=#>ClichéMag.com</a><br>Images provided by <a href=#>Creative Commons</a>, <a href=#>Flickr</a>, <a href=#>Unsplash</a>, <a href=#>Pexels</a> & <a href=#>Pixabay</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnJ6wqbHMmp5nm5%2BifK21xZ6qrbGcmny4tMicn2asqaWybrvFZqqenKWYsrN5wKucZrGfqnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhich-type-of-seducer-are-you.html&text=Which%20Type%20of%20Seducer%20Are%20You%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhich-type-of-seducer-are-you.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-type-of-seducer-are-you.html&title=Which%20Type%20of%20Seducer%20Are%20You%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhich-type-of-seducer-are-you.html&title=Which%20Type%20of%20Seducer%20Are%20You%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-type-of-seducer-are-you.html&title=Which%20Type%20of%20Seducer%20Are%20You%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhich-type-of-seducer-are-you.html&description=Which%20Type%20of%20Seducer%20Are%20You%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./angelina-jolie-alleges-brad-pitt-physical-abuse.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angelina Jolie Alleges Brad Pitt's &amp;quot;Physical Abuse&amp;quot; Started Before 2016 Plane Ride">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./where-is-kacey-montoya-ktla-today-bio-ethnicity-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where is Kacey Montoya KTLA today?
