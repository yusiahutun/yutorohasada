After a series of online tests and interviews, he was able to appear on the stage on 8th Feb. 2023 (Wednesday).</p><p>In his first match, he stood against Matthew Marcus and Becky Molder. He had a great impact on the winning of Matthew Marcus, who initially had the four-day winning streak. With just $10,000 he was set apart from the four-games-winning personality of Matthew Marcus. Now, he will return to defend his winning against the two other new champions or contestants- Scott Perry and Mira Hayward.</p><p>At the end of the show of the day, Ken Jennings softly blew by saying that Matthew Marcus will probably appear for the&nbsp; 2023 Tournament of Champions.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Dan Wohl Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Dan Wohl&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>1987</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>36 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Forest Hills, New York, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>High School Teacher</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Stanford University</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 8” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 173 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Green</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dan-Wohl-1.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Gary Wohl</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Danielle Wohl</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Andrew Wohl</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Who is his wife?</td><td>Marissa Wallace</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>–</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Dan is a happy living married man who had his marriage to be arranged in a haunted mansion on Halloween.
