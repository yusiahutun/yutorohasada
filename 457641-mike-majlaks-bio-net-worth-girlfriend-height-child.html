He was born and grew up in Milford, Connecticut, in a middle-class <a href=#>family</a>. His mother, Robin Majlak, worked at a retail company. His father (whom not much is known about) was a marketing manager at a tech company and a basketball coach. The YouTube star has two sisters, Gabby and Jillian Majlak.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aa2d96f73eecdb80.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Renee Portnoy? The truth about Dave Portnoy's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In his book, <i>The Fifth Vital</i>, Majlak revealed that he was a sharp child, and his parents usually called him a 'Brainiac.' However, he used to act out, which saw him make several trips to a psychologist's office. Ultimately, his parents decided to enrol him in a strict, all-boys Catholic school – Notre Dame of West Haven.</p><p class=align-left>While Majlak came from a seemingly ordinary American family, things at home were not always good. His parents divorced when he was 15 after their relationship fell apart completely. His father, who had consistently enforced strict rules, left the family. On top of that, he stopped paying for his <a href=#>private school</a> fee, forcing him to attend a rougher public school, Foran High School.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/07240a80e03ecc0a.jpg><p class=align-left>Majlak started acting out due to the problematic situation at home and being forced to move schools. Within a short time, he was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> introduced to drugs </a>by his friends and got hooked up on them. At around 16, he got injured and was given pain medication Ox*Contin to help with the pain during surgery.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/89b17b75e6c38285.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Louisa Jacobson's parents, husband, height, net worth, and movies</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After returning to school, he started taking the drug recreationally and was addicted to it when he was a high school senior. Majlak's drug problem got worse over time. First, he started taking other drugs such as Xanax and amphetamines. Sometime later, he was introduced to cocaine and got addicted.</p><p class=align-left>He even began dealing drugs to support his habit. When his mother found out, he kicked him out of their house, causing him to be homeless for a few years. A few years after graduating from <a href=#>high school</a>, while still suffering from drug addiction, Majlak enrolled in college.</p><p class=align-left>He attended Fordham University in New York. Unfortunately, the heavy course load and drug addiction were too much for him. Eventually, he dropped out of college. Fortunately, in 2010, Majlak went into rehab after several years of drug use and addiction. He got clean and has since turned his life around.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/03310f368344c145.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Paul Hollywood's sexuality, partners, and dating history</span></p></a><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>After getting sober, Majlak started doing <a href=#>odd jobs</a> such as filling in for his sister in her assistant job and walking dogs.
