Parton even asked herself the same question.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2014, she told T. The Guard that she and Dean were talking about expanding their family when they got married in 1966, but her health problems bothered her: “If we had had a girl, her name would be Carla… Anyway, we talked about it, and we dreamed about it, but it wasn’t meant to be,” she said.</p><p>In her thirties, Parton underwent a partial hysterectomy and found that she could not have children. “Suddenly, I was a middle-aged woman. I went through a dark period until I broke away from it,” Dolly said in an interview Made for Mothers. “We never thought about adopting,” she added. “I don’t think I had the time. I had my career and everything; I had younger brothers and sisters, so I had that responsibility and that joy and that duty.“</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dolly Parton is “the perfect babysitter.”</h2><p><a href=#>Dolly Parton</a> has always been a favorite aunt, a cool grandmother, and a fun babysitter. Let’s not forget that she is the godmother of Miley Cyrus!</p><p>Parton has talked about dealing with other people’s kids and telling The Huffington Post:&nbsp;“I am the perfect grandma, I am the perfect aunt, I am the perfect babysitter because I don’t have kids. So I bring them to me of my own choosing. They will not be thrown at me.”&nbsp;And if I keep them, if they get out of line, I just have to imply that I’ll bring them home or call their mother to pick them up. “</p><p>Parton is not only attracted to children, but they are attracted to her.</p><p>She knows why:&nbsp;“I have this high voice … I look like Mother Goose or one of those exaggerated characters, and children just gravitate to it,”&nbsp;she explained today in 2017.&nbsp;“You wouldn’t believe my place!”&nbsp;She told The Times UK. in 2010.&nbsp;“I have tree houses. I have caves. I love babysitting because it gives me the opportunity to play.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dolly Parton has become a “book lady” to millions of children.</h2><p><a href=#>Dolly Parton</a> has dedicated a large part of her life to caring for children. In 1990, she founded a non-profit organization called&nbsp;Imagination Library, a community-based reading initiative that sends a free book to children every month from their birth until the age of 5.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Her charity has donated more than 100 million books and earned her a nickname – “the book lady”. The library’s literacy mission is very personal to Parton. “My father and many of my relatives, who also grew up hard, large families, could not actually get a chance to go to school because they had to work,” she told CNBC. “My father could not read or write.”</p><p>Parton’s work for children does not end here. In 2017, she published a children’s album entitled I believe in you. Many of the songs are personal and deal with important social issues, how to stop bullying, and be responsible.</p><p>Parton told The Huffington Post The release of a children’s album had been a goal of hers for quite some time.&nbsp;“I’ve been stacking children’s songs for years,”&nbsp;she said,&nbsp;“I write songs for the Imagination Library with all the books we’ve released, and then I write personal songs for my little nieces, nephews, and friends, so it just seemed like a good time.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dolly Parton enjoying her “second childhood” as “Aunt Grandma”</h2><p>Speaking today, <a href=#>Dolly Parton</a> said that fate had led her to become the mother of many children, rather than just the mother of her own children.&nbsp;“God has a plan for everything,”&nbsp;she said,&nbsp;“I think it was probably his plan for me not to have children so that all children could be mine. And they are now.”&nbsp;</p><p>Her nieces and nephews call “Aunt Grandma,” and through her, Parton says she is now enjoying her “second childhood.”</p><p>Parton celebrated her 74th birthday in 2020. The Queen of the country has a booming music career and is surrounded by her loving family members and countless fans. In a way, she is happy that it is just her and her husband Carl Dean in their big house in Nashville.&nbsp;</p><p>“Now that Carl and I are older, we often say, ‘Aren’t you glad we didn’t have kids? Now we don’t have children to worry about,'”&nbsp;she told&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;in 2014.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmoZ2imnqqv4ywn7JllKS5rcWMqZirrJ%2Bjeq%2Bx1Z6pZqCRmXqktMilm6udnmQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-is-why-dolly-parton-never-had-children.html&text=Here%20is%20why%20Dolly%20Parton%20never%20had%20children&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-is-why-dolly-parton-never-had-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-is-why-dolly-parton-never-had-children.html&title=Here%20is%20why%20Dolly%20Parton%20never%20had%20children" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-is-why-dolly-parton-never-had-children.html&title=Here%20is%20why%20Dolly%20Parton%20never%20had%20children" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-is-why-dolly-parton-never-had-children.html&title=Here%20is%20why%20Dolly%20Parton%20never%20had%20children" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-is-why-dolly-parton-never-had-children.html&description=Here%20is%20why%20Dolly%20Parton%20never%20had%20children" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jackie-miller-james-poses-with-daughter-after-aneurysm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Influencer Jackie Miller James poses with daughter Knoxly for the first time after aneurysm that lef">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./23-astounding-facts-about-dan-lauria.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="23 Astounding Facts About Dan Lauria">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
