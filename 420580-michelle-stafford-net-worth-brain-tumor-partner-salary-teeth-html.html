However, her parents decided to move to Montrose, California, where she and her older sister, Janine, grew up. Her father is a lawyer by profession, while her mother is an executive at Universal Studios.</p><p class=align-left>Michelle Stafford chose to follow her mother's footsteps into the<a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/340805-top-10-latest-kenyan-movies-2020.html href=#> movie</a> industry, but as an actress rather than an executive. Immediately after graduating from high school, Michelle Stafford was doggedly determined to succeed in the <a href=#>world</a> of modelling, which she certainly did.</p><p class=align-left>Her successful modelling career had her living in different places around the globe. For instance, she lived in France, Italy and Japan. However, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Soap Opera Digest</a>, she was not entirely successful initially as she was slightly overweight.</p><p class=align-left>She usually got negative feedback from most of the agencies she reached out to, telling her that she did not have "the right look" to make it like a professional model. Despite all that, Michelle was got an agent and landed herself several TV commercials.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/41002f39029fedb2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maria Sansone: Family, career, thyroid cancer, what happened</span></p></a><h2>Health and personal issues</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/84b8d468c49615c7.png><p class=align-left>Soap Opera Digest also states that trouble soon followed the actor immediately after high school, as she started experiencing swelling on her left eyelid. It was determined to be a brain tumour after a visit to the doctor. Despite how scary that might sound, Michelle Stafford’s brain tumour did not hold her back, she had<a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/412667-prayer-surgery-10-powerful-thoughts-prayers.html href=#> surgery,</a> and the tumour was found to be benign.</p><p class=align-left>The experience did not only change her perspective in life, but it also boosted her confidence. After this scary episode of her life, she decided to lose weight and dye her hair the trademark red colour. According to <a id=https://soaps.sheknows.com/the-young-and-the-restless/news/580561/young-restless-michelle-stafford-dental-pain/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Soaps</a>, as of October 2020, Michelle Stafford had reportedly been suffering from "constant low-grade dental pain.”</p><p class=align-left>Despite the issue bringing her a lot of pain, she had decided to keep on the low. However, people found out about Michelle Stafford’s teeth from a post about the issue on her Instagram account. She decided to speak out about the case after finding a doctor that helped take care of it once and for all.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a67b0fe2dea34767.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Barbara Bain: husband, daughter, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><h2>Modelling</h2><p class=align-left>Michelle's newfound confidence made her irresistible as a <a href=#>model</a>. As a result, she signed with L. A Models, which catapulted a successful modelling career. She enjoyed several appearances in top modelling scenes such as Tokyo, Milan and Paris.</p><h2>A career in acting</h2><p class=align-left>Of all these places, Italy had the most profound effect that would, later on, bolster her presence in the acting world. It was at around this time she discovered her desire to act. Living in Italy helped bring her out of her conservative shell.</p><p class=align-left>This certainly emboldened her confidence, a much-needed quality if one is to succeed in acting. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Earth Organization</a>, after a year in Italy, Michelle Stafford realized her desire to become an actress.</p><p class=align-left>She decided to leave Italy and came back to Los Angeles, California, where she took up acting classes to kick start an acting career. After taking acting classes, getting an agent and doing multiple auditions, Stafford finally had her first big break.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8baa2b427f746edf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lizzie Broadway: boyfriend, family, career, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><h3>Film and TV appearances</h3><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">IMDb,</a> the actress played her first screen role as Frankie in Fox’s teen soap opera <i>Tribe</i>, which was cancelled after three months. However, this was just a preview for the massive slew of Michelle Stafford's movies and TV shows to follow.</p><p class=align-left>The cancellation of<i> Tribe </i>did not put her down. She kept on grinding. She starred in <i>Body of Proof </i>in 1993, appeared in <i>Another Midnight Run</i> in 1994 and in fox's soap opera <i>Pacific Palisades </i>in 1997 that aired only 13 episodes.</p><p class=align-left>However, her big break came in 1994 when she played Phyllis on CBS's <i>The Young and the Restless</i>. While her role in the series was expected to be short, she impressed the producers, which prompted them to extend her contract. It is sufficient to say that she nailed the part as she went on to play the character on and off for at least sixteen years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9bc02c755369609b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jessica Dean biography: husband, family, salary, career, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 1999, Michelle Stafford had her first big break in the films industry when she starred in the top-rated thriller <i>Double Jeopardy</i>.
